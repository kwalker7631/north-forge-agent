"""Relational RUN-to-report completeness check for the North Forge handoff bundle.

Replaces the old date-only heuristic in ``scripts/collect-logs.{ps1,sh}`` (which
proved only "a report exists dated >= the newest ledger id" — one same-day report
made every run that day look covered; ERR-2026-09-07-004 / Codex F-02 / R-01).

This is *relational*: every ``RUN-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN`` id that appears anywhere in the
ledger must have a row in ``logs/ledger/reports/REPORT-MANIFEST.md``, and that row
must either name a session report that actually exists in the handoff out-dir and
mentions that run id, or be an explicit ``ledger-only`` disposition. A run with no
row, or a row pointing at a missing / mismatched report, is a **FAIL** (not WARN).

Invoked by both collectors; it does the heavy parsing once so the PowerShell and
POSIX paths stay byte-identical in behaviour. Output is one ``LEVEL<TAB>message``
line per finding on stdout (LEVEL in OK / WARN / FAIL). Exit 0 = no FAIL.

    python scripts/lib/report_completeness.py \
        --ledger-dir <out>/ledger  --reports-dir <out>  [--manifest <path>]

``--manifest`` defaults to ``<ledger-dir>/reports/REPORT-MANIFEST.md``.

# The owner's standing rule: every session report ends with a literal closing line
#   Handoff bundle: HANDOFF_<YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM>.zip (sha256: <64 hex>) - created.

# the REAL zip name and hash before the report counts as complete. The check is a
# POSITIVE structural match (a real HANDOFF_<date>_<time>.zip name + a real 64-hex
# sha256), not a blacklist of specific forbidden words — "PLACEHOLDER", "PENDING",
# "computed after the zip is sealed", or anything else that isn't the real shape
# all fail the same way (RUN-2026-09-10-006 hardened this after two real reports
# briefly carried "PENDING" / "computed after..." pre-hash text — both already
# failed correctly, but no regression test pinned it down). The *last* such line
# in the body is the closing line — an earlier one quoting the format (in a fenced
# block, which is stripped first) is not it. Only the zip-name and sha capture
# groups are inspected, so a parenthetical that uses the word "placeholder" in
# prose does not trip it. Known residual limitation: this validates FORMAT, not
# that the sha is the genuine hash of a file that actually exists — a
# syntactically perfect but fabricated line still passes (no drive-root path is
# threaded through to cross-check against; see
# test_well_formed_but_fabricated_hash_is_a_known_limitation).
