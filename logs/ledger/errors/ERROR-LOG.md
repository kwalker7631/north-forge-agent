# North-Forge Error & Anomaly Register

Append-only. One row per **fault**: build break, failed test batch, bad merge, upstream
regression, secret exposure, unexpected repo state — anything that is *wrong* and needs
fixing. An open *judgment call* (a choice between defensible options) is not a fault —
it goes in [`../decisions/DECISION-LOG.md`](../decisions/DECISION-LOG.md) as a
`DECISION-` instead. See [`README.md`](../README.md) § `ERR-` vs `DECISION-`.

Never delete a row — close it by moving status to `RESOLVED` (or `WONTFIX` /
`ACCEPTED-RISK` / `SUPERSEDED`, naming the record that replaces it) with a resolution
note and the resolving `CHG-` id.

`ERR-` id scheme, severities, the `Confidence` vocabulary, and `Run:` ids are defined
in [`README.md`](../README.md). Severity: **CRITICAL** · **HIGH** · **MEDIUM** ·
**LOW** · **INFO**.

> Entries opened before `ledger-schema v2` (everything below dated 2026-09-06 up to
> and including `ERR-2026-09-06-005`) predate the `Confidence` and `Run:` fields.
> Read their claims as **Confirmed Fact** unless the entry says otherwise, and their
> run as the `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001` / `-002` sessions. Not backfilled.

## Open

### ERR-2026-09-06-001 — HIGH — Secret hygiene

- **Opened:** 2026-09-06 · **Base:** hermes@820106d4a5 (2 behind upstream/main)
- **Source:** `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001` F-05
- **What:** `.env` in the repo root contains a real, non-placeholder `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  (108-char value, line 545) plus 11 benign upstream debug/timeout toggles copied from
  `.env.example`.
- **Exposure:** `.env` is matched by `.gitignore` (`.env` + `.env.*`); it is **not tracked**
  and `git log --all -- .env` is empty (re-verified `AUDIT-2026-09-06-002`). No leak path
  found in this checkout. Risk is local (disk, shoulder-surf, accidental paste into an
  issue/PR/screenshot/log).
- **Update 2026-09-06 (`AUDIT-2026-09-06-002`):** the same key value also sits at
  **`D:\.env`** (portable-drive root, outside every git repo) — same rotation applies
  there. The in-repo mitigation (`.gitignore` broadening + `.githooks/`) is now
  **committed** to local `main` (`CHG-2026-09-06-010`), not just working-tree state.
- **Status:** **OPEN** — exposure structurally mitigated and committed; user action still required on the key.
- **Mitigation shipped 2026-09-06** (the "never push `.env`" rule):
  - `CHG-2026-09-06-007` — `.gitignore` broadened to `.env` + `.env.*` + `.op.env`
    (`!*.example` / `!*.sample`). Previously `.env.production`, `.env.staging`, etc.
    were **not** ignored — see `ERR-2026-09-06-003`.
  - `CHG-2026-09-06-008` — `.githooks/pre-commit` + `.githooks/pre-push` refuse to
    commit or push any real `.env`; `core.hooksPath = .githooks` set in this checkout.
  - History re-verified: `git log --all -- .env` is empty — `.env` has never been
    committed on any ref.
- **Required action (still open):**
  1. Confirm this key is meant to live on this machine.
  2. If its provenance or exposure history is at all uncertain, **rotate it** at
     `console.anthropic.com` and update `.env`.
  3. Never paste `.env` contents into commits, PRs, screenshots, or chat.
  4. On a fresh clone, run `sh .githooks/install` to re-arm the guard.
- **Do NOT** run `git clean -x`/`-X` in this repo — it would delete `.env`.

### ERR-2026-09-08-012 — LOW — `nf-setup.ps1` reports `Provisioning failed (exit )` when `$LASTEXITCODE` is null

- **Opened:** 2026-09-08 · **Base:** hermes@7ee2b69151 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-08-005
- **Source:** surfaced fixing `tests/test_nf_tier_enforcement.py::test_nf_setup_ps1_provisions_and_survives_stderr`
  (`CHG-2026-09-08-018`) — the test failed under `scripts/run_tests.sh`'s `env -i`
  until an explicit Windows env was passed.
- **What:** `scripts/nf-setup.ps1`'s `Invoke-NfTier` / `Invoke-Hermes` do
  `$script:NfExit = $LASTEXITCODE` after `& $pyExe …`. If the child never
  launches (bad `$pyExe`, AV block, or — the test case — a PowerShell that cannot
  spawn any child because `PATH`/`SystemRoot`/`ComSpec` are unset), `$LASTEXITCODE`
  keeps its prior value, which can be `$null`. `if ($script:NfExit -ne 0)` then
  fires (`$null -ne 0` is true) and the script prints `Provisioning failed
  (exit )` with an empty code.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — reproduced this run.
- **Exposure / impact:** **Fails safe** — it reports failure and writes no
  provisioning record; the message is just uninformative. Access-tier code, so
  not self-fixed (ledger Agent-Conduct rule). Never observed in a real operator
  shell (all of cmd / Explorer / Task Scheduler / the Tauri installer pass a full
  environment).
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Required action:** coerce a null `$LASTEXITCODE` to a non-zero code with a
  clear message (`$script:NfExit = if ($null -eq $LASTEXITCODE) { 1 } else { $LASTEXITCODE }`,
  or check `$?`). Its own change, not to be folded into a test-only fix. Owner /
  next tier-logic pass.

## Resolved

### ERR-2026-09-10-001 — HIGH — `import hermes_cli.main` raises `NameError` (`_desktop_ssh_backend` undefined)

- **Opened:** 2026-09-10 · **Base:** hermes@0e9fc2cc15 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-10-001 · **Resolved:** RUN-2026-09-10-003 (`CHG-2026-09-10-003`)
- **Source:** surfaced running `tests/test_nf_tier_enforcement.py` while finishing
  `CHG-2026-09-10-001` — `test_integration_full_defaults_to_pin_but_switches`
  fails because its `python -c "import hermes_cli.main"` subprocess aborts.
- **What:** `hermes_cli/main.py:642`, inside `_apply_profile_override()`, calls
  `_desktop_ssh_backend(argv)` but **no `def _desktop_ssh_backend` exists in the
  tree**. `git grep` finds only the call site — on local `main` (`bb64aab4f3`)
  **and on `origin/main`**. Commit `677e8ed8a4` ("fix(desktop): SSH remote
  backend stops following the host's sticky active_profile", 2026-09-09) added
  both the helper (a 1-line `return "--ssh-session-token-file" in argv`) and its
  call; a later `Merge branch 'main' into main` kept the call and dropped the
  `def`. `_apply_profile_override()` is invoked at **module scope**
  (`main.py:679`), so `import hermes_cli.main` raises
  `NameError: name '_desktop_ssh_backend' is not defined` whenever the branch is
  reached — i.e. on an unprovisioned drive, or a Full-tier drive whose
  `HERMES_HOME` is not a `profiles/<name>` dir and with no `-p`. A Basic-tier
  pinned drive returns earlier and is unaffected.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — reproduced directly:
  `python -c "import sys; sys.argv=['hermes','chat']; import hermes_cli.main"` →
  `NameError` at `main.py:642` (traceback through the module-level
  `_apply_profile_override()` at line 679).
- **Exposure / impact:** the North Forge / Hermes CLI **fails to start** on an
  unprovisioned or Full-tier drive in this state. Present on the public
  `origin/main`. Not caused by `CHG-2026-09-10-001` (which touches
  `nf_admin.py` / `nf_tier.py` / `cli.py` comments / a test — never `main.py`);
  reproduced with this run's changes reverted.
- **Update 2026-09-10 (`RUN-2026-09-10-002`):** still OPEN — `main.py:645` after
  the `git pull --rebase` onto `origin/main` `23135479a2` (a +163
  `NousResearch:main` sync) **still** calls `_desktop_ssh_backend` with no `def`
  in the tree. The sync did not carry the fix; the verbatim restore from
  `677e8ed8a4` is still owed.
- **Resolution 2026-09-10 (`RUN-2026-09-10-003`, `CHG-2026-09-10-003`):** owner
  directed the fix this pass. `def _desktop_ssh_backend(argv: list) -> bool:`
  (docstring + `return "--ssh-session-token-file" in argv`) restored **verbatim
  from `677e8ed8a4`**, placed immediately before `_apply_profile_override` in
  `hermes_cli/main.py` (its position in that commit). Verified:
  `python -c "import hermes_cli.main"` now succeeds; the covering test
  `tests/hermes_cli/test_apply_profile_override.py::…::test_desktop_ssh_serve_child_skips_active_profile`
  survived the merge and passes; `tests/test_nf_admin.py` **17 passed**;
  `tests/test_nf_tier_enforcement.py` **30 passed** (the previously-failing
  `test_integration_full_defaults_to_pin_but_switches` now passes). Landed and
  pushed to `origin/main` in the `RUN-2026-09-10-003` batch.
- **Status:** RESOLVED

### ERR-2026-09-09-003 — MEDIUM — `query_session_listing` visibility filter can hide older eligible sessions

- **Opened:** 2026-09-09 · **Base:** hermes@990473a79c (21 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-09-001 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** AGENT D follow-through on the `session_listing.py` sparse-match
  hardening scoped but not started in `RUN-2026-09-08-005`; note
  `D:\logs\SESSION-LISTING-ADAPTIVE-WIDENING_2026-09-09.md`.
- **What:** `hermes_cli/session_listing.py::query_session_listing` fetched a
  single fixed `limit * 4` window from `list_sessions_rich`, then filtered
  unnamed / current-session rows in Python. If enough newer unnamed sessions
  filled that window, an older *named* session that would be displayable was
  never fetched and so never shown — the same failure shape as the `hermes logs`
  sparse-match bug (`ERR-2026-09-08-008`).
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — the fixed-window fetch + after-the-fact Python
  filter is in the code; `test_older_named_session_survives_many_newer_unnamed`
  and `test_widens_more_than_once` reproduce the miss and the fix.
- **Exposure / impact:** wrong output only (a listing / picker omits a session
  the caller asked to see); no data loss, nothing shipped incorrectly. Two
  callers, `limit` 10/50.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-09 — `limit <= 0` returns `[]` before any query; the
  fetch widens `limit * (4, 8, 16)` from row 0 (never `OFFSET`), stopping when
  `limit` displayable rows survive or the DB returns a short window; the filter
  is factored to `_displayable()`. `tests/hermes_cli/test_session_listing.py` +5.
  Resolving change: `CHG-2026-09-09-002`.

### ERR-2026-09-09-002 — HIGH — `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` never checks `-VenvDir` and `-DataDir` against each other

- **Opened:** 2026-09-09 · **Base:** hermes@990473a79c (21 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-09-001 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** AGENT D "R1" bootstrap-safety pass; note
  `D:\logs\NORTH-FORGE-R1-VENV-CLEANUP_2026-09-09.md`.
- **What:** the path guard (`ERR-2026-09-07-003` / `CHG-2026-09-07-015`) checks
  `-VenvDir` and `-DataDir` each against the **checkout**, but never against
  **each other**. A caller passing an equal / trailing-separator / case-variant /
  nested `VenvDir`+`DataDir` pair (only reachable via explicit `-VenvDir` /
  `-DataDir` — the default `north-forge.cmd` path derives siblings and is
  unaffected) would have a `-Force` rebuild's `Remove-Item -Recurse` on `VenvDir`
  delete `HERMES_HOME`.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — reproduced by
  `test_reject_venv_equals_or_contains_data` (×4 mangles) before the guard.
- **Exposure / impact:** data-loss class (destroys the data folder), but only on
  a non-default explicit-overlap invocation; nothing shipped that does this.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-09 — new `if (Test-PathOverlap $VenvDir $DataDir) { … exit 1 }`
  guard after the existing RepoRoot guards (those byte-unchanged); equal /
  trailing-sep / case / nested all rejected. Resolving change: `CHG-2026-09-09-001`.

### ERR-2026-09-09-001 — HIGH — `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` reused / deleted a venv dir with no proof it owned it

- **Opened:** 2026-09-09 · **Base:** hermes@990473a79c (21 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-09-001 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** AGENT D "R1" bootstrap-safety pass; note
  `D:\logs\NORTH-FORGE-R1-VENV-CLEANUP_2026-09-09.md`. Follow-on to
  `ERR-2026-09-07-006` (`CHG-2026-09-07-020`) — readiness was made a real probe
  there, but ownership was still never established.
- **What:** `bootstrap` decided "already bootstrapped?" from a bare `hermes.exe`
  + `.nf-bootstrapped` existence check, and its only cleanup line was
  `if ($Force -and (Test-Path $VenvDir)) { Remove-Item -Recurse -Force }`. So an
  interrupted extract, a bare `Scripts\` tree, or an unrelated directory sitting
  at `<checkout>-venv` was either trusted as a working venv or — under `-Force` —
  recursively deleted, with nothing proving North Forge had created it. Readiness
  failure was conflated with the right to delete.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — the existence-only early return and the
  `-Force`-gated `Remove-Item` are in the pre-change script; the new state-matrix
  tests (`_R1_CASES` ×6, `test_force_does_not_override_unknown_directory`,
  `test_direct_bootstrap_refuses_unknown_venv_dir_without_preflight`) exercise
  every shape.
- **Exposure / impact:** could delete an operator's unrelated directory that
  happened to be at the sibling venv path (e.g. a hand-made `…-venv` folder), or
  silently run against a half-built venv. Default path lands a real venv; no
  known field loss, but the `-Force`/GUI-repair path is exactly where a
  clean-machine retest would exercise it.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-09 — readiness (`Test-NfVenvReady`) and ownership (new
  read-only `scripts/lib/nf-venv-state.ps1` → `Get-NfVenvState`) are now separate
  decisions feeding a `create` / `rebuild` / `refuse` / `none` state table.
  `UnknownDirectory` / `UnsafePath` ⇒ unconditional `refuse` (`-Force` does not
  override); `EmptyDirectory` populated in place; the single `Remove-Item` is
  immediately preceded by a canonical-path + ownership re-check; every decision
  logs `venv_state= ownership= action= reason=`; the data-folder skin seed runs
  only on first-time `create`. `nf-preflight.ps1` reduced to a repair *request*.
  `+11` path-safety tests, `+2` launcher-hardening (preflight-never-runs / GUI
  path), preflight source test rewritten. Resolving change: `CHG-2026-09-09-001`.

### ERR-2026-09-08-011 — MEDIUM — `hermes_time.get_timezone()` can publish a zone under a stale cache identity

- **Opened:** 2026-09-08 · **Base:** hermes@7ee2b69151 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-08-005 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** upstream code-quality review (coordinator batch).
- **What:** `get_timezone()` captures `_timezone_cache_identity()`, resolves the
  zone name **outside** `_cache_lock` (config file I/O), then
  `_tz_cache.setdefault(identity, (name, tz))` under the captured identity. A
  profile / `HERMES_TIMEZONE` switch landing during the resolve — genuinely
  concurrent now that tier/pin gives the gateway and the dashboard separate
  profile contexts — publishes this profile's zone under the pre-switch identity
  (poisoning that slot) or hands it back for the wrong profile.
- **Confidence:** Field-Reasoned — the race window is in the code; not
  reproduced live (timing), but the new regression test drives the exact
  interleave with a patched resolver.
- **Exposure / impact:** wrong timezone shown for a profile in a multiplexed
  process (gateway + dashboard). Not shipped before this fork.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-08 — `get_timezone()` re-reads `_timezone_cache_identity()`
  after the resolve and retries on a shift instead of publishing a mismatched
  pair. `tests/test_hermes_time_cache.py` (2). Resolving change: `CHG-2026-09-08-025`.

### ERR-2026-09-08-010 — MEDIUM — Model-selection guard fails **open** on an unexpected registry error

- **Opened:** 2026-09-08 · **Base:** hermes@7ee2b69151 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-08-005 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** upstream code-quality review (coordinator batch).
- **What:** `hermes_cli/auth_model_picker._confirm_selection_guards()` wrapped the
  whole `model_selection_guards` call in `except Exception: warnings = []` — an
  unexpected guard-registry error was indistinguishable from "no warnings fired",
  so an unvetted model change was saved silently.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — the swallow is in the code; new test drives a
  raising `selection_warnings`.
- **Exposure / impact:** a cost / data-policy guard failing to load would let a
  flagged model through the post-login picker with no prompt. Not shipped before
  this fork.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-08 — a non-`ImportError` exception is logged with context
  and returns `False` (model unchanged, user told to check the log);
  `ImportError` (feature absent from the build) still returns `True`.
  `tests/hermes_cli/test_auth_model_picker_guards.py` (4). Resolving change:
  `CHG-2026-09-08-023`.

### ERR-2026-09-08-009 — LOW — `cron.load_jobs()` never persists an empty repaired jobs map

- **Opened:** 2026-09-08 · **Base:** hermes@7ee2b69151 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-08-005 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** upstream code-quality review (coordinator batch).
- **What:** the write-back guard was `if jobs and repair:` — a legacy id-keyed map
  or bare list that repairs to an **empty** canonical list was read fine in memory
  but never rewritten, so every `load_jobs()` re-ran the repair path forever.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — reproduced by the extended test.
- **Exposure / impact:** cosmetic + a small repeated cost; no data loss. Upstream
  latent bug.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-08 — guard changed to `if repair:`; the file is rewritten
  to `{"jobs": []}` and the next load is idempotent. `tests/cron/test_jobs.py`
  extended. Resolving change: `CHG-2026-09-08-022`.

### ERR-2026-09-08-008 — MEDIUM — `hermes logs` filtering misses sparse matches and mishandles multiline records

- **Opened:** 2026-09-08 · **Base:** hermes@7ee2b69151 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-08-005 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** upstream code-quality review (coordinator batch) — same failure
  shape as the already-fixed log-filtering sparse-match bug lineage.
- **What:** two bugs, one root shape (per-line filter over a fixed recent window):
  **(A)** the filtered path over-read only `max(N*20, 2000)` lines from the tail —
  3 `ERROR` records behind 2001 `INFO` lines ⇒ `hermes logs -n 2 --level ERROR`
  returned nothing; **(B)** filtering ran per line, so a continuation line
  (traceback frame / wrapped text, no level or timestamp) **passed** `--level` /
  `--since` (a rejected record's traceback leaked) and **failed** `--session` /
  `--component` (a matched record's traceback was dropped).
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — both reproduced by new tests.
- **Exposure / impact:** `hermes logs` / the dashboard `/api/logs` view could hide
  the very ERROR the operator is looking for, or show noise from rejected records.
  Upstream latent bug.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-08 — `_iter_records()` groups a timestamped header with its
  continuation lines; `_matches_filters()` runs on the header only; a record is
  kept/dropped whole. Filtered `_read_tail` streams the whole file once, last N
  matching records in `deque(maxlen=N)` (O(N) memory, rotation-bounded scan). New
  `_FollowFilter` gives `-f` the same inheritance. `+12` tests. Resolving change:
  `CHG-2026-09-08-021`.

### ERR-2026-09-08-007 — MEDIUM — Worktree GC archives reclaimed scratch to a hardcoded `~/.hermes`

- **Opened:** 2026-09-08 · **Base:** hermes@7ee2b69151 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-08-005 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** upstream code-quality review (coordinator batch).
- **What:** `hermes_cli/worktree_gc._archive_untracked()` copied untracked scratch
  out of a doomed worktree to `Path.home()/".hermes"/"archive"/"worktree-prune"`,
  ignoring `HERMES_HOME` / the active profile / a managed or relocated home.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact.
- **Exposure / impact:** on a non-default `HERMES_HOME` the reclaimed files land
  where nothing looks for them; the tree is still removed, so the operator's only
  copy is somewhere unexpected (not lost — the copy succeeds). Upstream latent bug.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-08 — `dest = get_hermes_home()/"archive"/"worktree-prune"/…`.
  Fail-safe unchanged (`None` ⇒ keep the tree). Test fixture split `HOME` /
  `HERMES_HOME`; `+1` test for the archive-failure path. Resolving change:
  `CHG-2026-09-08-019`.

### ERR-2026-09-08-006 — MEDIUM — `nf-setup.ps1` drive test invisible to the CI Windows lane

- **Opened:** 2026-09-08 · **Base:** hermes@7ee2b69151 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-08-005 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** manual observation while consolidating the shared Windows test env.
- **What:** `tests/test_nf_tier_enforcement.py` gated its `nf-setup.ps1`
  integration test with a module-level
  `_WINDOWS_ONLY = pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform != "win32", …)`.
  `scripts/ci/list_os_marked_tests.py` scopes the Windows lane's import set by
  **whole-word, case-sensitive** match on `windows_only`; `_WINDOWS_ONLY` / the
  `skipif` never matched, so the lane never imported the file and the test never
  ran there.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — `list_os_marked_tests.py windows_only` did not
  list the file before, does after.
- **Exposure / impact:** silent zero coverage of the `nf-setup.ps1` /
  `nf_tier` provisioning drive on the one lane that could run it. No wrong
  behaviour shipped; a real regression there would have passed CI.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-08 — the alias is deleted; the test is
  `@pytest.mark.windows_only` (`conftest.pytest_collection_modifyitems` still
  skips it off-`win32`). File now appears in the lane list; executed green on this
  win32 host. Resolving change: `CHG-2026-09-08-018`.

### ERR-2026-09-08-005 — MEDIUM — `hermes_logging` handler-registration check-then-append race

- **Opened:** 2026-09-08 · **Base:** hermes@7ee2b69151 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-08-005 (opened + resolved same run) · reviewed independently
  before landing.
- **Source:** upstream code-quality review (coordinator batch).
- **What:** `hermes_logging._add_rotating_handler()` scanned
  `_queued_file_handlers` for a handler already writing the resolved log path
  **outside** `_queue_state_lock`, then appended **inside** it. `setup_logging()`
  takes no lock and its `_logging_initialized` guard runs *after* registration, so
  two callers on different threads (gateway init vs a CLI/plugin path) could both
  pass the scan and each append a live `RotatingFileHandler` for the same file.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — the unlocked check-then-act is in the code; new
  test forces the interleave with a `Barrier` and asserts one handler + one
  closed loser.
- **Exposure / impact:** duplicate log lines, two open fds on one file, and two
  handlers independently deciding to roll it — worst on Windows. Also a latent
  mutation-during-iteration hazard vs `enable_profile_log_routing()`. Upstream
  latent bug.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-08 — `_handler_covers_path()` extracted; the pre-check runs
  under the lock and `_register_queued_handler(handler, dedup_path=…)` re-checks
  under the lock — decision + append are one critical section, loser closed after
  the lock is released. `tests/test_hermes_logging.py` +1 concurrency test
  (`ThreadPoolExecutor` so worker exceptions surface). Resolving change:
  `CHG-2026-09-08-017`.



### ERR-2026-09-08-004 — MEDIUM — `editions/penny-pincher` persona oversells what it does

- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — the phrases were read in `editions/penny-pincher/SOUL.md`.
- **What:** `SOUL.md` said *"I hold the running picture"* / *"I keep track"* /
  *"tracking bills and due dates"* — language that implies a maintained structured
  ledger. The edition has **no ledger mechanism**; it only has the chassis's
  memory of what the user typed. It also gave affordability answers without
  naming what the answer omitted.
- **Impact:** a recipient could over-trust a "what's left this month?" number.
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-08 (`RUN-2026-09-08-004`, `CHG-2026-09-08-016`). Wording
  only, no mechanism (per PC-2026-09-08-005's stated scope): "I write it down" /
  "I work only from what you give me" / "no bank connection, no transaction feed,
  no ledger of its own"; affordability answers now always name what they leave out.
  `editions/penny-pincher/README.md` matched.

### ERR-2026-09-08-003 — HIGH — `editions/pine-barron-farms` canon packet is never loaded

- **Opened:** 2026-09-08 · **Base:** hermes@c076d653a2 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-08-004 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** Codex progress-check **PC-2026-09-08-004**.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — reproduced this session: `SOUL.md` says *"I
  follow the loaded canon packet exactly"* but nothing in the edition, the
  chassis, or the launch path reads `canon/PINE_BARRON_FARMS_CANON.md`. Dropping a
  packet in did nothing.
- **Impact:** the edition's core promise (canon consistency for an AI video
  studio) was unfulfillable — the agent had no studio facts and no way to get
  them, and no signal that they were missing.
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-08 (`RUN-2026-09-08-004`, `CHG-2026-09-08-015`). New
  `editions/pine-barron-farms/canon/load_canon.py` (stdlib, exit 0 always) emits a
  `canon loaded: <path>, sha256=<hash>, <n> bytes` receipt + the packet between
  BEGIN/END markers, or a `WARNING: canon packet NOT FOUND` message naming every
  path checked. Loaded two existing-mechanism ways, **no core engine change**: a
  session-start command mandated by `SOUL.md`, and the new `skills/pbf-canon/`
  skill (its body — the loader invocation + how to read the output — assembles
  into the preloaded-skills system prompt). `distribution.yaml` ships both.
  `tests/test_pbf_canon_loader.py` (6) — present / absent / truncation / CLI
  exit-0, and an end-to-end proof that a fact from a test canon file reaches the
  assembled context.

### ERR-2026-09-08-002 — MEDIUM — Installer trusts frontend `repoRoot`; multi-drive autodetect picks the first

- **Opened:** 2026-09-08 · **Base:** hermes@c076d653a2 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-08-004 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** Codex progress-check **PC-2026-09-08-002** and **-003** (same root
  cause — validation gaps in `apps/bootstrap-installer`'s Rust backend).
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — read in `src-tauri/src/{repo,bootstrap}.rs`:
  `run_bootstrap` fed a frontend-supplied `repo_root` straight to
  `repo::describe` (which does not re-check `is_checkout()` and never consults
  `on_system_drive`), and `resolve_checkout`'s drive scan returned the **first**
  drive with a checkout — so with valid checkouts on two drives it silently picked
  one instead of asking.
- **Impact:** a bootstrap could run against a non-checkout or a system-drive path,
  or against the wrong one of several drives, with no prompt.
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-08 (`RUN-2026-09-08-004`, `CHG-2026-09-08-014`). One
  shared `repo::validate_target(&Path)` gate (canonicalize → real checkout
  [`bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` **and** `pyproject.toml`] → not the system drive),
  called by **both** `set_repo_root` (the picker) and `run_bootstrap` immediately
  before spawning PowerShell. `resolve_checkout` now auto-picks **only** when
  exactly one checkout exists across every visible drive; otherwise `detect_repo`
  returns `source="ambiguous"` and the location screen forces an explicit choice
  and disables Install. `+8` Rust unit tests (`src-tauri` 9 → 17).
- **Status:** RESOLVED. (`tauri build` not re-run — Rust/TS, out of the pytest
  lane; `cargo test` 17/17, `cargo build`, `tsc`, `eslint` clean.)

### ERR-2026-09-08-001 — HIGH — `nf_tier.load()` can raise on a signed-but-malformed record → enforcement silently off

- **Opened:** 2026-09-08 · **Base:** hermes@c076d653a2 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-08-004 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** Codex progress-check **PC-2026-09-08-001**.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — reproduced this session: a correctly-signed
  record with `"schema": "one"` made `_load_uncached()` hit
  `int(rec.get("schema", 0))` → `ValueError`, which escaped `load()`;
  `_nf_tier_gate()`'s broad `except Exception: return None` then treated the drive
  as un-provisioned — a Basic drive would run `-p <other>` unblocked.
- **Impact:** a malformed (or forward-incompatible) but genuinely-signed
  provisioning record turned **off** tier enforcement instead of failing closed.
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-08 (`RUN-2026-09-08-004`, `CHG-2026-09-08-013`).
  `_load_uncached()` now validates every signed field's type/bounds explicitly
  (schema is an `int` and `== SCHEMA`, `bool` rejected; tier/pinned_edition/
  installed_editions/text fields typed) and every failure — plus a defensive outer
  `except` — returns `Provisioning(STATE_TAMPERED)`. `load()` is now total over
  arbitrary signed JSON. `_nf_tier_gate()` additionally fails **closed**
  (`("block", …)`) when an unexpected error occurs and a provisioning record file
  is physically present (new import-free `_nf_provisioning_file_present()`).
  `+11` tests in `tests/test_nf_tier_enforcement.py` (19 → 30) — the exact Codex
  repro (signed record, non-numeric `schema`) as a unit test **and** an
  integration test (`hermes -p kyocera` exits non-zero, `HERMES_HOME` unmoved).
- **Status:** RESOLVED.

### ERR-2026-09-07-007 — MEDIUM — Secret defenses narrower than "credential protection" implies

- **Opened:** 2026-09-07 · **Base:** hermes@233757037d (6 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-07-006 (opened) · RUN-2026-09-08-004 (resolved — filename half)
- **Source:** Codex audit **F-09** (residual scope beyond the `ERR-2026-09-07-005`
  bypass).
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact for implemented coverage; Field-Reasoned for
  residual exposure likelihood.
- **What:** the secret controls work but are narrow — commit scanning recognizes
  only selected AWS / GitHub / Slack token shapes; filename blocking was
  essentially `.env`-family only (`credentials.json`, `id_rsa`, `*.pfx`, `*.p12`,
  service-account JSON not uniformly blocked); `.gitignore` is not a security
  boundary and `git add -f` bypasses it; the handoff redactor skips binary/large
  files; both hooks yield to `--no-verify` (CI must stay authoritative).
- **Resolved (filename half):** 2026-09-08 (`RUN-2026-09-08-004`,
  `CHG-2026-09-08-009`). `.githooks/secret-guard` `is_forbidden()` broadened
  beyond `.env` to SSH private keys (`id_rsa`/`id_dsa`/`id_ecdsa`/`id_ed25519`),
  `*.p12`/`*.pfx`/`*.pkcs12`/`*.jks`/`*.keystore`, `credentials.json` /
  service-account JSON, `.netrc`/`_netrc`/`.pgpass`/`.htpasswd`, and PEM/`.key`
  private keys — with a public-CA-bundle allowlist, a `test/`/`fixtures/` path
  carve-out, and an explicit `ALLOWLIST` escape hatch. New
  `.githooks/tests/secret-guard.sh` (31 cases, `sh` + `dash`); `nf-secret-scan.yml`
  now runs both hook self-test suites and `secret-guard --tree`/`--range` in CI.
  Verified `--tree HEAD` clean on the current tree.
- **Not done (out of scope this run):** the maintained pinned CI content scanner
  (Gitleaks-class) for broad provider coverage — R-02.4. The three-regex
  `content-scan` still covers only AWS/GitHub/Slack shapes. Track as a follow-up;
  it is a coverage *addition*, not a regression.
- **Status:** RESOLVED (filename coverage — the concrete half). Broad-provider
  content scanning remains a future enhancement, not an open fault.

### ERR-2026-09-07-004 — HIGH — Ledger completeness check compares dates, not RUN IDs

- **Opened:** 2026-09-07 · **Base:** hermes@233757037d (6 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-07-006 (opened) · RUN-2026-09-08-004 (resolved)
- **Source:** Codex audit **F-02** (see `logs/CODEX-AUDIT-2026-09-07.md`).
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — reproduced and verified fixed this session.
- **What:** `scripts/collect-logs.sh` (~lines 183–203) and the equivalent
  PowerShell logic proved only *"a report exists dated ≥ the newest ledger ID's
  date."* One unrelated same-day report made every run that day look covered; a
  report could omit its `RUN-` id entirely and still satisfy the check.
- **Impact:** the collector did **not** close the evidence gap it was built for.
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-08 (`RUN-2026-09-08-004`, `CHG-2026-09-08-008`). New
  `scripts/lib/report_completeness.py` — a *relational* check invoked by both
  collectors: every `RUN-` id in the ledger must have a row in the new
  `logs/ledger/reports/REPORT-MANIFEST.md` (run id, report basename, covered ids,
  source-of-truth, sha256), and that row must name a session report that exists in
  the out-dir and mentions the run id, or be an explicit `ledger-only`
  disposition. A run with no row, or a row pointing at a missing / wrong report,
  is now **FAIL** (not WARN). Also: a `Run:` / `Covers:` / `Source-Of-Truth:`
  header on every report + `templates/SESSION-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md`; unresolved
  ledger `[[wiki-link]]` warning; a stale-row warning; a sha256-drift warning.
  The four un-reported recent runs (`RUN-2026-09-07-011`, `RUN-2026-09-08-001/002/003`)
  were **backfilled** with proper reports so the check comes back clean.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.

### ERR-2026-09-07-006 — CRITICAL — Launcher trusts "hermes.exe exists" as environment readiness

- **Opened:** 2026-09-07 · **Base:** hermes@233757037d (6 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-07-006 (opened) · RUN-2026-09-07-008 (reclassified + fixed)
- **Source:** Codex audit **F-05**; **reclassified CRITICAL 2026-09-07** after a
  real first-handoff failure confirmed the fault in the field — not theoretical.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — reproduced **and** verified fixed this session
  (`RUN-2026-09-07-008`): a foreign-machine venv was simulated two ways — (a) a
  healthy venv whose *only* defect is `.nf-bootstrapped`'s `repo=` pointing at a
  different path → the new probe reports `python_exec=PASS import_hermes_cli=PASS
  module_in_checkout=PASS marker_repo_matches=FAIL`, `Ready=False`; (b) a full
  venv layout with `python.exe` present but its recorded base `home` gone and the
  marker → another path → `nf-preflight.ps1` detects it, calls
  `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1 -Force` (rebuild, **not** launch), re-probes green,
  and the data folder's canary file survives. `tests/test_nf_preflight_readiness.py`
  (10 cases) + the real `.\north-forge.cmd --version` (probes `action=none
  result=ready`, then starts).
- **What:** `north-forge.cmd` and `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` both treated
  "`hermes.exe` (and `.nf-bootstrapped`) exist" as proof the run environment was
  ready. A Python venv built on one machine is **not portable** to another — it
  fails or crashes on the new machine — and there was **no readiness check** to
  catch this before a launch attempt. A renamed / copied / re-lettered checkout
  had the same effect: both files present, interpreter broken or importing stale
  code from a path that no longer exists.
- **Impact:** the launcher hands a broken environment straight to the agent on a
  fresh machine — i.e. the **first handoff fails**. No data loss (data dir is
  never touched), but the product does not start.
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-07 (`RUN-2026-09-07-008`, `CHG-2026-09-07-020`,
  `NF-v0.5.4`). New `scripts/lib/nf-readiness.ps1` runs a **four-check
  launch-time probe** before every launch — (1) the venv's `python.exe` executes,
  (2) `import hermes_cli` succeeds, (3) the resolved `hermes_cli` lives under
  **this** checkout, (4) the marker's `repo=` equals this checkout's path. New
  `scripts/nf-preflight.ps1` (called by `north-forge.cmd`) **silently rebuilds
  the venv — never the data folder** — on any failure, matching the existing
  self-healing principle, and appends **one line per launch** to
  `<parent>\<checkout>-launcher.log` *before* Python is invoked (timestamp,
  computer name, drive/repo path, per-check PASS/FAIL, recovery action).
  `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`'s early-return now runs the same probe. Resolving
  change: `CHG-2026-09-07-020` (+ `tests/test_nf_preflight_readiness.py`).
- **Status:** RESOLVED. (`R-03` step 3 done; steps 4–6 — Python-ABI/arch fields
  in the marker, native-Windows path/UNC test matrix, a data-side diagnostic log
  — remain future work, not tracked as a fault.)

### ERR-2026-09-07-005 — HIGH — `.githooks/content-scan` whitespace-path bypass

- **Opened:** 2026-09-07 · **Base:** hermes@233757037d (6 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-07-006 (opened) · RUN-2026-09-07-007 (fixed)
- **Source:** Codex audit **F-03** — reproduced by Codex in a scratch repo.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — reproduced **and** verified fixed this session
  (`RUN-2026-09-07-007`): a `ghp_`-shaped token in `"my dir/config file.txt"`,
  scanned via `content-scan --commits HEAD~1..HEAD` — the pre-fix script
  (`git show HEAD~1:.githooks/content-scan`) returned exit 0 "clean"; the fixed
  script exits 1 and reports `…:my dir/config file.txt:1:GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_…"`.
- **What:** in `.githooks/content-scan` the `--commits` gate captured the
  changed-path list as newline text and expanded it **unquoted** into `_scan`
  (`_scan "$c" $paths`). A legal path like `dir/file name.txt` word-split into two
  non-existent pathspecs, so the blob was never scanned. `content-scan --commits`
  returned exit 0 / "clean" for a planted GitHub token in such a file. Both the
  pre-push hook and the `nf-secret-scan.yml` CI job use this mode, so an ordinary
  filename with a space defeated the content gate. The six existing self-tests
  covered only ASCII/no-space paths.
- **Impact:** live gap in an advertised security mechanism — a secret in a
  space-containing filename passed both local and CI content scanning.
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-07 (`RUN-2026-09-07-007`, `CHG-2026-09-07-019`,
  `NF-v0.5.3`). The `--commits` path no longer stores paths in shell variables at
  all — new `_scan_commit` reads `git diff-tree --no-commit-id -r --no-renames
  --diff-filter=d -z` (NUL-delimited, quoting disabled) one raw record at a time
  and hands `git grep` the **post-image blob OID** (`_scan_blob`); no path is ever
  passed to git as a pathspec on the gate path, so word-splitting cannot happen.
  `--tree` / `--worktree` (which only ever pass the literal pathspec `.`) are
  unchanged. `.githooks/tests/run.sh` gains 7 cases: secret in a space / tab /
  leading-dash / non-ASCII filename, a rename-into-a-spaced-path in one commit, an
  add-then-delete of a spaced path across the range, and a negative control
  (spaced filename, no secret ⇒ not flagged). 13/13 pass under both `bash` and
  `dash` (CI's shell); `sh -n` / `dash -n` clean.
- **Not touched:** `.githooks/secret-guard` (the `.env` *filename* guard) — out of
  scope for this fix.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.

### ERR-2026-09-07-003 — HIGH — `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` `-Force` can delete the checkout

- **Opened:** 2026-09-07 · **Base:** hermes@233757037d (6 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-07-005 (opened + resolved same run)
- **Source:** Codex audit finding **F-04** (data-loss).
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — reproduced this session: a fake checkout
  (`pyproject.toml` + a canary file) passed as **both** `-RepoRoot` and
  `-VenvDir` with `-Force`. Before the fix the guard let it through; the script
  would then reach `Remove-Item -LiteralPath $VenvDir -Recurse -Force`. After the
  fix the run exits non-zero at the guard with a "Refusing to bootstrap" error
  and the checkout is untouched. Covered by
  `tests/test_bootstrap_north_forge_path_safety.py` (11 cases; the
  script-execution ones are Windows-only, ran green here).
- **What:** the path-safety guard rejected a venv/data path **strictly inside**
  the repo root — `"$full".TrimEnd('\').ToLower().StartsWith($RepoRoot.TrimEnd('\').ToLower() + '\')`
  — but a path **equal** to the repo root does not start with `repoRoot + '\'`,
  so `-VenvDir <repo root>` passed the check. On `-Force`,
  `Remove-Item -LiteralPath $VenvDir -Recurse -Force` then recursively deletes the
  working tree. `repo-root-inside-venv` (e.g. `-VenvDir <parent of checkout>`)
  was also unguarded. The equality gap applied to `-DataDir` too.
- **Exploitability:** the default path is **safe** — `north-forge.cmd` calls
  `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` with **no** `-VenvDir` / `-DataDir`, so it always
  uses the computed `<parent>\<leaf>-venv` / `-data` siblings, which the guard
  (old and new) accepts. The bug bites only a caller that explicitly passes a
  venv/data path equal to (or containing, or contained by) the checkout. No such
  caller exists in-repo. Marked HIGH (unrecoverable local data loss if hit;
  recoverable from `origin/main` since the tree is pushed) — the audit framed it
  "critical".
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-07 (`RUN-2026-09-07-005`, `CHG-2026-09-07-015`,
  `NF-v0.5.1`). New helpers `Get-CanonicalDir` (`[IO.Path]::GetFullPath` + trim
  `\` `/` + keep a bare drive root) and `Test-PathOverlap` (ordinal-ignore-case
  `[string]::Equals`, then a `StartsWith(other + '\')` both directions). The
  guard now rejects venv/data **equal to**, **inside**, or **containing** the
  checkout, for both dirs. Genuine siblings (`<leaf>-venv`, `<leaf>-data`) are
  still accepted — verified by `test_accepts_genuine_siblings`.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.

### ERR-2026-09-07-002 — LOW — Upstream test suite fails collection on Windows

- **Opened:** 2026-09-07 · **Base:** hermes@a7198a8855 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-07-003 (opened) · RUN-2026-09-07-004 (accepted)
- **Source:** post-rebase test run for `CHG-2026-09-07-010` (the `upstream/main`
  sync). Already flagged informally in the `RUN-2026-09-07-002` handoff note
  (`IDENTITY-RUNTIME_2026-09-07.md`, "two pre-existing Windows test issues") at the
  old base `hermes@61d30533f7` — so it **predates the sync**; logged as its own
  `ERR-` now because the 333-commit sync widened it (upstream `b818085298`
  "repoint … 13 tests" touched `test_doctor_journal_modes.py`) and it now aborts
  collection of the whole `tests/hermes_cli/` directory, not just one file.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — reproduced this session: `uv run --extra dev
  python -m pytest tests/hermes_cli/` aborts with
  `ERROR collecting tests/hermes_cli/test_doctor_journal_modes.py … AttributeError:
  module 'os' has no attribute 'geteuid'` and `Interrupted: 1 error during collection`.
- **What:** several upstream test modules evaluate `os.geteuid()` as an **eager
  argument** to a `@pytest.mark.skipif(...)` decorator, which runs at import /
  collection time — before the companion `@pytest.mark.skipif(os.name == "nt", …)`
  can suppress it. `os.geteuid` does not exist on Windows, so collection of the whole
  directory aborts. Known modules: `tests/hermes_cli/test_doctor_journal_modes.py`
  (last touched upstream by `b818085298`), and by grep also
  `test_ensure_acp_launcher.py`, `test_ssh_ownership_endpoint.py`,
  `test_update_autostash.py`, `tests/plugins/platforms/photon/test_sidecar_paths.py`,
  `tests/test_hermes_state_readonly_preflight.py`,
  `tests/tools/test_local_cwd_permission_fallback.py`,
  `tests/tools/test_stage2_hook_api_server_keygen.py` (not all confirmed to fail at
  collection — some may call `geteuid()` inside a function body, which is fine).
- **Not North Forge's:** every listed file is **byte-identical to `upstream/main`**
  (`git diff upstream/main HEAD -- <file>` empty). NF touches none of them. This is a
  pre-existing upstream Windows-portability defect that the `CHG-2026-09-07-010` sync
  simply pulled in; it is **not** a regression from `RUN-2026-09-07-003` steps 2/4,
  and North Forge's own targeted suites are green (238 passed / 4 skipped, see
  `CHG-2026-09-07-010`).
- **Impact:** an unfiltered `pytest` on Windows can't collect. Targeted runs
  (`pytest <file>::<node>`) and non-Windows CI are unaffected. Low.
- **Options considered:**
  1. Carry a small local test-compat shim (e.g. a `conftest.py` `getattr(os,
     "geteuid", lambda: -1)` fallback, or `--ignore` the offending files on Windows)
     — keeps a full local Windows run possible, adds fork drift on every merge.
  2. Wait for upstream to fix it; rely on Linux CI + targeted Windows runs meanwhile.
  3. Report upstream.
- **Resolved (ACCEPTED-RISK):** 2026-09-07 (`RUN-2026-09-07-004`) — owner decision:
  **accept as-is, option 2.** No local `conftest.py` shim and no `--ignore` list is
  added — that would put fork drift on `tests/` (a surface NF otherwise keeps
  byte-identical to upstream) on every merge, to paper over a defect that is
  upstream's to fix. North Forge relies on upstream's Linux CI plus targeted
  Windows runs (`pytest <file>::<node>`), which are unaffected. **Revisit trigger:**
  upstream fixes the eager-`skipif` pattern (drop this note), *or* a full
  unfiltered local Windows `pytest` run becomes necessary for NF work (then add the
  minimal `conftest.py` `getattr` shim under a new `CHG-`). Reporting upstream
  (option 3) is encouraged but not tracked here. Recorded by `CHG-2026-09-07-014`;
  no code change.
- **Status:** ACCEPTED-RISK (owner, `RUN-2026-09-07-004`). Pre-existing upstream
  Windows-portability defect; NF touches none of the affected files.

### ERR-2026-09-06-002 — MEDIUM — Fork identity / version drift

- **Opened:** 2026-09-06 · **Base:** hermes@820106d4a5 (2 behind upstream/main)
- **Source:** `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001` F-06, F-08
- **What:** two things were bundled under one id — (a) a **fault**: `origin/main` was
  0 ahead / 2 behind `upstream/main`, a stale pristine mirror; (b) a **choice**:
  `README*.md`, `SOUL.md`, `LICENSE`, and package metadata are all still
  upstream-branded, and whether to rebrand or stay a thin downstream was undecided.
- **Resolved (fault half) 2026-09-06:** `git rebase upstream/main` replayed the
  ledger commit onto `693641aa8b` (no conflicts); `git push origin main`
  fast-forwarded `origin/main` `820106d4a5` → `e6c97b43ef` (the 2 upstream commits +
  the ledger commit). Fork is now 0 behind `upstream/main`. Resolving change:
  `CHG-2026-09-06-014`.
- **Superseded-by:** `DECISION-2026-09-06-001` — the identity/rebrand **choice** was
  migrated to the decision register (`ledger-schema v2`, `CHG-2026-09-06-015`). It was
  never a fault; it does not belong here. The maintainer has since chosen **full
  rebrand** (2026-09-06); tracking of that now lives on `DECISION-2026-09-06-001`

### ERR-2026-09-06-003 — MEDIUM — Secret hygiene (`.gitignore` gap)

- **Opened:** 2026-09-06 · **Base:** hermes@820106d4a5 (2 behind upstream/main)
- **Source:** manual check while implementing the "never push `.env`" rule
- **What:** `.gitignore` enumerated `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`,
  `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.op.env` — but **not** `.env.production`,
  `.env.staging`, `.env.ci`, or any other `.env.<name>`. Such a file would not have
  been ignored and a plain `git add .` would have staged it.
- **Exposure:** none realised — no such file exists in the working tree or history.
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-06 — `.gitignore` now uses `.env` + `.env.*` + `.op.env`
  with `!*.example` / `!*.sample`. Verified with `git check-ignore` across
  `.env.production` / `.env.staging` / `deep/nested/.env` / `app/.env.prod`.
  Resolving change: `CHG-2026-09-06-007`.

### ERR-2026-09-06-004 — LOW — Stray Windows cache tree in repo root

- **Opened:** 2026-09-06 · **Base:** hermes@820106d4a5 (2 behind upstream/main)
- **Source:** `git status` after hook setup showed `?? %SystemDrive%/`
- **What:** a literal directory `%SystemDrive%/ProgramData/Microsoft/Windows/Caches/`
  containing Windows icon-cache DB files (`cversions.2.db`, `*.ver0x*.db`) appeared
  in the repo root (birth 2026-09-06 17:55). Created by some Windows process running
  with cwd = the repo and an **unexpanded** `%SystemDrive%` env var. Not produced by
  git — not reproducible from `git add` / `git commit`.
- **Exposure:** none — untracked; deleted before any commit.
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-06 — directory removed; `.gitignore` guards added
  (`/%SystemDrive%/`, `Thumbs.db`, `ehthumbs.db`, `[Dd]esktop.ini`, `$RECYCLE.BIN/`).
  Resolving change: `CHG-2026-09-06-009`.
- **Recurred 2026-09-06 (`AUDIT-2026-09-06-002` F-03):** the tree reappeared
  (birth 18:01, ~6 min after the first deletion). Deleted again (`CHG-2026-09-06-012`).
  The `/%SystemDrive%/` guard held — it never became git-visible. Stays RESOLVED;
  chasing the offending process is open-item #6 on `AUDIT-2026-09-06-002`.
- **Status:** RESOLVED (recurrence is expected and harmless while the guard stands).

### ERR-2026-09-06-005 — LOW — pytest / mock artifacts in the working tree

- **Opened:** 2026-09-06 · **Base:** hermes@820106d4a5 (2 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** — (pre-`RUN-` tracking; `AUDIT-2026-09-06-002` session — retro-note added under `ledger-schema v2`)
- **Source:** `AUDIT-2026-09-06-002` F-02 (`git status` after a test run)
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — the paths were listed by `git status` and inspected on disk before deletion.
- **What:** untracked, non-ignored paths written into the `north-forge-agent` repo
  root by test runs on this Windows checkout:
  - `MagicMock/mock._session_db.db_path/{3165824711312,3165827767312}` (+ `.fts_rebuild.lock`
    / `.quarantine.lock`) — a test left `_session_db.db_path` as a `MagicMock` and
    code opened `str(mock)` as a real path.
  - `C:UserskwalkAppDataLocalTemphermes-pytest-tmproot-2oumyv71…` / `…root-iyod624l…`
    (4 files, 0 B) — pytest tmp paths materialised as literal filenames in cwd.
  - `logs.zip` (462 KB) — a zipped copy of `logs/` dropped in the root.
- **Exposure / impact:** none realised — all untracked, deleted before any commit.
  Risk was a `git add -A` sweep and name-shadowing of real Windows paths.
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-06 — deleted (`CHG-2026-09-06-012`); `.gitignore` guards
  added — `MagicMock/`, `*hermes-pytest-tmp*`, `*pytest-tmproot*`, `*pytest-of-*`,
  `/logs.zip` (`CHG-2026-09-06-011`). Verified `git status` clean afterward.
- **Status:** RESOLVED (may recur; guards make recurrence harmless. Root-causing the
  test/tool is `AUDIT-2026-09-06-002` open-item #6).

### ERR-2026-09-07-001 — LOW — `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` cross-volume slow path

- **Opened:** 2026-09-07 · **Base:** hermes@61d30533f7 (13 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-07-002
- **Source:** `FIRST-LAUNCH-WITNESS_2026-09-07` (AGENT E's first-launch run on `E:\`) —
  measured, not fixed by that agent (witness scope, no edit authority).
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — timed on two drives: `E:\` first run 395.7 s
  wall (uv reported `Installed 67 packages in 6m 25s`); `D:\` after the fix 7.4 s
  cold / 5.0 s warm (`Installed 67 packages in 740ms`).
- **What:** `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` let uv's package cache stay at its
  default location under `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on `C:` while building the venv on the
  checkout's own drive (`E:\north-forge-agent-venv`, `D:\north-forge-agent-venv`).
  uv installs by hardlinking from cache into the venv; across volumes the hardlink
  fails and uv full-copies every package instead (`warning: Failed to hardlink
  files; falling back to full copy`). Net: a first `north-forge.cmd` double-click
  took **~6.5 min** instead of the "~7 s" `CHG-2026-09-07-005` advertised.
- **Exposure / impact:** performance and first-impression only — the bootstrap
  produced a correct venv, just slowly, with a warning that reads like a failure.
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-07 — `CHG-2026-09-07-008`: the script now sets
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR` to a sibling of the venv (`<parent>\.uv-cache`, same volume)
  before the uv calls, unless the operator already set it. Re-measured on `D:\`:
  link step `740ms`, total 5–7 s, warning gone, sibling venv `hermes.exe
  --version` works.
- **Status:** RESOLVED. Note: `scripts/collect-logs.*` and the `.sh` bootstrap
  variant are unaffected (no `.sh` bootstrap exists); if one is added it needs the
  same `UV_CACHE_DIR` line.

### ERR-2026-09-11-001 — CRITICAL — `origin/main` force-reset to upstream by fork-sync (2nd occurrence), wiping all 186 fork commits

- **Opened:** 2026-09-11 · **Base:** hermes@8d79c2ff57 (228 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-11-002
- **Source:** Owner report — "README.md on north-forge-agent has reverted to
  Hermes-forward content again - the second time this has happened" — requesting
  root cause, not a blind re-patch.
- **What:** `README.md`'s own commit history never actually reverted — every
  `Merge branch 'NousResearch:main' into main` commit kept North Forge branding,
  and a clean `git merge-tree` simulation of the next upstream sync on top of the
  last good commit (`9998dd8028`, `CHG-2026-09-10-002`) produced no conflict and
  no drift. The regression was not in any commit reachable from the local clone.
  `git fetch origin main` reported a **forced update**
  (`63e3209593...1021a03256`); the new `origin/main` tip (`1021a03256`, "chore:
  map contributor email for jakobdylanc") is **byte-identical to an upstream
  `NousResearch/hermes-agent` commit** (`git merge-base --is-ancestor` confirms
  it's an ancestor of `upstream/main`). `gh api repos/kwalker7631/north-forge-agent`
  confirms `fork: true`, `parent: NousResearch/hermes-agent` — a genuine GitHub
  fork relationship, which exposes the "Sync fork" → "Discard commits" action
  (and its API equivalent, `POST .../merge-upstream`) alongside the normal
  fast-forward sync. That action does a **branch-level ref replacement**, not a
  per-file merge, so it bypasses git's merge logic (and any `.gitattributes`
  merge strategy or file-level exclusion) entirely. `gh api
  .../branches/main/protection` returned 404 — **`main` had zero branch
  protection** — nothing gated the reset. Diffing the old fork tip against the
  new upstream-only tip: **186 commits, 728 files, +19276/-30843 lines** —
  every `NF-v*` commit gone, not only `README.md`'s branding (`SOUL.md`,
  `BRANDING.md`, `logs/ledger/**`, the CLI skin, the installer, all of it).
  `[[north-forge-agent-ledger]]` already recorded one prior "a GitHub 'sync
  fork' merged upstream mid-pass" event (`RUN-2026-09-07-001`) — that one
  happened to fast-forward cleanly with no fork-only commits lost at the time;
  this is the same mechanism landing destructively now that the fork carries
  real history.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — blob SHAs, `merge-base --is-ancestor`, the
  `gh api` fork/protection responses, and the forced-update message were all
  captured directly this run, not inferred.
- **Exposure / impact:** total — the public `origin/main` briefly presented as
  stock Hermes Agent with zero North Forge identity, and every fork-only commit
  (186) was unreachable from `origin/main` until recovered. Local `main`
  retained full history throughout (the local clone predates the reset), so
  nothing was unrecoverable.
- **Resolved:** 2026-09-11 — owner authorized (a) force-pushing local `main`
  (`63e3209593`, contains all 186 commits incl. `CHG-2026-09-10-002`) back onto
  `origin/main`, verified via `gh api .../contents/README.md` blob SHA match
  post-push; (b) branch protection on `main`
  (`allow_force_pushes: false`, `allow_deletions: false`, `enforce_admins: true`,
  and — confirmed by the protection API response itself —
  **`allow_fork_syncing: false`**, the exact GitHub-native gate for this
  mechanism); (c) a CI detection layer, `.github/workflows/nf-branding-guard.yml`
  (push/PR to `main` + daily schedule + `workflow_dispatch`), grep-checking the
  category-1 identity markers from `BRANDING.md` §1 in `README.md`, `SOUL.md`,
  `BRANDING.md` — ran green on the push that added it
  (`gh run list --repo kwalker7631/north-forge-agent --workflow=nf-branding-guard.yml`).
  Resolving changes: CHG-2026-09-11-003 (branch protection), CHG-2026-09-11-004
  (`nf-branding-guard.yml`). Decision record: DECISION-2026-09-11-001.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.
