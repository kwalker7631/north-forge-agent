REM north-forge.cmd - double-click launcher. Bootstraps on first run, then starts `hermes`.
REM Minimal, single-drive: venv + data are siblings of this checkout (see scripts\bootstrap-north-forge.ps1).
REM Not the hardened install - that waits on DECISION-2026-09-06-003. Pass args straight through: north-forge.cmd gateway
REM Every launch also self-heals, against the CURRENT machine + drive letter/path:
REM   - the run environment itself: a real readiness probe (does the venv's
REM     python run? does it import hermes_cli from THIS checkout? does the
REM     .nf-bootstrapped marker match?) + a silent venv rebuild if not - a venv
REM     is not portable between machines  (ERR-2026-09-07-006 / CHG-2026-09-07-020)
REM   - the North Forge CLI skin copy in HERMES_HOME\skins\  (CHG-2026-09-07-012)
REM   - "<drive>:\Start North Forge.lnk", a drive-root double-click launcher  (CHG-2026-09-07-013)
REM Drive-letter changes are safe (venv + data are siblings that move together). A
REM CHECKOUT-FOLDER RENAME is not: the data-folder name is derived from the leaf
REM folder name, so a rename points HERMES_HOME at a fresh empty folder and the old
REM conversations/config/credentials look lost. The block below detects that and
REM asks - it never silently adopts or silently ignores the old folder (Codex audit Fix 2).
