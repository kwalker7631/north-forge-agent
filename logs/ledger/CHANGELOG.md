## [NF-v0.11.1] — 2026-09-11 — hermes@8d79c2ff57 (217 behind upstream/main)

**`RUN-2026-09-11-001` (continued) — private-edition provisioning, tested for real end-to-end.** PATCH — docs only, no code change. Ran the actual admin path, not just the internal `_stage_source` check from `CHG-2026-09-11-001`: real `scripts\bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` (fresh venv+data siblings), then real `scripts\nf-setup.ps1 -Tier full -Pin kyocera -Installed kyocera` against the populated `private-editions\kyocera\` — the `private-editions/<name>/` fallback fired correctly ("installing 'kyocera' from private-editions\kyocera"), `provisioning.json` written and signed, `hermes profile list` / `python -m hermes_cli.nf_tier show` both correct, and a rendered `/edition` (`_exec_edition`) call confirmed the exact chat-visible output lists `kyocera [pinned default]`. A one-shot `hermes -z` prompt reached the expected "no inference provider configured" stop (no API key in this scratch run) — confirms profile resolution completes before model dispatch, nothing edition-specific broke it.

**`CHG-2026-09-11-002`** — `docs/BUILDING-A-DRIVE.md`: new "Pinning to a private edition (e.g. Kyocera)" subsection under Step 2, with the exact tested command sequence (clone into `private-editions/<name>/`, bootstrap, `nf-setup.ps1`, launch, verify).

Verification artifacts (venv, data dir, drive-root shortcut, and the test provisioning record/passcode created for this check) were deleted afterward - this was a real-run verification, not a fixture left in place. `private-editions/kyocera/` itself was left in place (real content, not a leftover).

Run: `RUN-2026-09-11-001`

## [NF-v0.11.0] — 2026-09-11 — hermes@8d79c2ff57 (217 behind upstream/main)

**`RUN-2026-09-11-001` — `private-editions/` discovery path for named vertical skill-sets (e.g. Kyocera).** MINOR — new capability, no access-tier enforcement change. Kenneth's instruction: a named vertical skill-set is real proprietary content (not a persona overlay), so it never belongs in the public `editions/` tree — it lives in its own private repo, structured the same way (`distribution.yaml` + `SOUL.md` + `skills/`), and gets git-cloned directly into a sibling `private-editions/<name>/` at the repo root.

**`CHG-2026-09-11-001`** — `.gitignore`: added `private-editions/` (whole subtree, never tracked). `scripts/nf-setup.ps1`: the per-edition install-source resolution (`$srcDir`, previously hardcoded to `editions/<name>/` only) now falls back to `private-editions/<name>/` when `editions/<name>/` has no `distribution.yaml`; header docstring updated to describe the fallback. `editions/README.md`: new "Private editions" section documenting the mechanism (the private repo's own access control is the security boundary for "can this be installed"; the existing admin passcode / tier gate in `hermes_cli/nf_tier.py`, unchanged, still governs "can a given drive switch into it").

Verified this session, not just read from code (all against a real local clone at `private-editions/kyocera/`, populated from `kwalker7631/north-forge-hermes-edition` after that repo's own restructuring — see its session report):
- `hermes_cli.profile_distribution._stage_source('private-editions/kyocera', …)` resolves the manifest (`name: kyocera`, `version: 0.1.0`) via plain filesystem calls — confirmed by direct invocation, not inspection alone. Git-tracked/staged/ignored status of the source directory is irrelevant to it, so gitignoring `private-editions/` does not block installation.
- `hermes profile install private-editions/kyocera -y` (real CLI, isolated scratch `HERMES_HOME`) succeeds end-to-end: `hermes profile list` and `hermes profile info kyocera` both show it correctly (`kyocera@0.1.0`).
- `git status` / `git add -A && git status` show nothing from `private-editions/` after populating it — confirmed the ignore holds, not assumed.
- `/edition` (`hermes_cli/slash_exec.py::_exec_edition`) needs no change — it sources its "Installed editions" menu from `list_profile_names()` (`hermes_cli/profiles.py:280`), a disk scan of `<HERMES_HOME>/profiles/`, so it will list `kyocera` automatically once installed, same as any other profile.
- `hermes_cli.nf_tier.enforce_startup_profile` has no edition-specific branch — a Full-tier `-p kyocera` / `hermes profile use kyocera` resolves identically to any other installed profile. No new code needed for switching.

**Also recorded, not part of this change:** re-added the `upstream` remote (lost when `D:` was wiped and re-cloned) and fetched it to record the coordinate above — `origin/main` is genuinely **217 commits behind `upstream/main`** now (merge-base `8d79c2ff57`, vs. the `0e9fc2cc15` / "0 behind" recorded as of `RUN-2026-09-10-002`). This gap opened from normal upstream velocity between sessions, not from anything in this run; syncing it is a separate follow-up, not attempted here.

Run: `RUN-2026-09-11-001`

## [NF-v0.10.2] — 2026-09-10 — hermes@0e9fc2cc15 (0 behind upstream/main)

**`RUN-2026-09-10-006` — sanity-checked the end-of-task logging pipeline
after the owner noticed `logs.zip` uploaded identically three times running
while dated `HANDOFF_*.zip` files each differed.** **PATCH** — ledger/test
hardening; no functional behaviour change. **Part 1 (no fix needed):**
`collect-logs.{ps1,sh}` → `D:\logs.zip` and the drive-root
`HANDOFF_<date>_<time>.zip` are two separate things, not one step — the
former is the one script-generated artifact (verified: 7 distinct sha256
values across 7 real invocations tonight, so it is not stuck); the latter is
currently a fully manual copy-and-seal step this agent performs by hand each
session, backed by no script in the repo. `logs.zip` is not obsolete — it
feeds the dated file and the completeness self-check depends on it — but it
was never meant to be the thing a person repeatedly re-uploads; recommended,
not built: document that plainly, and consider scripting the dated-copy step
so it stops depending on an agent remembering it correctly every time.
**Part 2 (confirmed already correct, hardened anyway):** re-ran
`report_completeness.py` against the two reports named in the task
(`PERSONA-CHECK-AND-BACKUP-CLEANUP_2026-09-10.md`,
`VERIFY-LAUNCH-GIT-PULL_2026-09-10.md`) as they exist on disk — both **PASS**.
The unfilled "HANDOFF_PENDING.zip (sha256: PENDING)" / "sha256: computed
after the zip is sealed…" text the task cited exists only inside the two
already-sealed `HANDOFF_*.zip` bundles as an intentionally-frozen pre-hash
snapshot (documented in both reports' own closing lines) — `report_
completeness.py` only ever reads the standalone `D:\logs\` copies, so nothing
slipped through the gate. Directly tested `check_handoff_line()` against
both exact phrasings regardless: **both already FAIL**, correctly, because
`HEX64_RE` rejects any non-hex sha256 regardless of the word introducing it
— not because of a `"PLACEHOLDER"` word-match. `CHG-2026-09-10-005` below
removes that now-visibly-redundant word clause and hardens the regression
suite for both real phrasings plus one new, honestly-disclosed limitation
(a syntactically well-formed but fabricated hash still passes — no drive-root
path is threaded through to cross-check against).

Also found and fixed in passing (ledger self-correction, not part of either
task question): `NF-v0.10.1`'s block was appended *after* `NF-v0.10.0` in
this file — the reverse of the documented "newest first" order (`RUN-
2026-09-10-003` inserted it below the block whose closing line it matched,
rather than above it). Moved the whole block above `NF-v0.10.0`; a pure
reorder (66 insertions / 66 deletions in the diff), no content change.

Verification: `tests/test_report_completeness_handoff_line.py` **12 passed**
(was 9; +3); `ruff check` clean on both changed files;
`report_completeness.py` against the live ledger + `D:\logs\` still exits 0.

### Fixed

- **CHG-2026-09-10-005** — **`scripts/lib/report_completeness.py`:
  `check_handoff_line()` — removed a dead, redundant word-based clause
  (`"PLACEHOLDER" in zipname`, already fully subsumed by the existing
  `HANDOFF_ZIPNAME_RE` structural match — a string containing that word can
  never match the fully-anchored pattern, so the clause never fired on its
  own) and rewrote the module comment to state plainly that enforcement is a
  positive structural match (a real `HANDOFF_<date>_<time>.zip` name + a real
  64-hex sha256), not a forbidden-word list, plus documented the honest
  residual limitation (format-only; no cross-check that the hash is the
  genuine hash of a file that actually exists).** No behavior change — both
  cited real-world unfilled phrasings ("HANDOFF_PENDING.zip (sha256:
  PENDING)", "sha256: computed after the zip is sealed…") already failed
  before this change; confirmed by running the pre-change code against both
  strings directly. `+tests/test_report_completeness_handoff_line.py`: 3
  new tests (`test_pending_zip_and_hash_fail`,
  `test_computed_after_the_zip_is_sealed_fails`,
  `test_well_formed_but_fabricated_hash_is_a_known_limitation`), 12 total.
  Paths: `scripts/lib/report_completeness.py`,
  `tests/test_report_completeness_handoff_line.py`,
  `logs/ledger/CHANGELOG.md` (reorder). Run: RUN-2026-09-10-006.

## [NF-v0.10.1] — 2026-09-10 — hermes@0e9fc2cc15 (0 behind upstream/main)

**`RUN-2026-09-10-003` — two independent fixes: (1) restored the
`_desktop_ssh_backend` helper a bad merge dropped from `hermes_cli/main.py`, so
`import hermes_cli.main` no longer raises `NameError` on an unprovisioned or
Full-tier drive (closes `ERR-2026-09-10-001`, HIGH); (2) the RUN-to-report
completeness check now FAILs a session report whose mandatory closing
`Handoff bundle:` line is still an unfilled `PLACEHOLDER` template.** **PATCH** —
a correctness fix + a ledger-tooling fix; no schema, engine, or access-tier
behaviour change. Both fixes verified, then this block plus the four
previously-held commits (`CHG-2026-09-10-001`..`-002` and their ledger commits)
were pushed to `origin/main` as an owner-authorised batch.

Verification (Windows-native, `.venv` pytest): `import hermes_cli.main` succeeds
(was `NameError` at `main.py:645`); `tests/test_nf_admin.py` **17 passed**;
`tests/test_nf_tier_enforcement.py` **30 passed** (was 29p/1f — the failure was
`ERR-2026-09-10-001`, now gone); `tests/hermes_cli/test_apply_profile_override.py`
**8 passed, 3 pre-existing Windows-only failures** (`test_sudo_*`, two
profile-fixture `SystemExit` cases — identical on the untouched tree; the two
`_desktop_ssh_backend` / `invocation_id` cases that failed on the untouched tree
now pass); `tests/test_report_completeness_handoff_line.py` **7 passed** (new);
`report_completeness.py` against the live `D:\logs\` + ledger still exits 0
(COMPLETE).

### Fixed

- **CHG-2026-09-10-003** — **`hermes_cli/main.py`: restored `def
  _desktop_ssh_backend(argv)`.** Commit `677e8ed8a4` ("fix(desktop): SSH remote
  backend stops following the host's sticky active_profile", 2026-09-09) added
  both the helper (`return "--ssh-session-token-file" in argv`) and its call in
  `_apply_profile_override()`; a later `Merge branch 'main' into main` kept the
  call and dropped the `def`. Because `_apply_profile_override()` runs at module
  scope, `import hermes_cli.main` raised
  `NameError: name '_desktop_ssh_backend' is not defined` whenever the branch was
  reached — an unprovisioned drive, or a Full-tier drive whose `HERMES_HOME` is
  not a `profiles/<name>` dir and with no `-p`. Restored **verbatim** from
  `677e8ed8a4` (docstring included), placed immediately before
  `_apply_profile_override` as in that commit. The covering test
  (`tests/hermes_cli/test_apply_profile_override.py::…::test_desktop_ssh_serve_child_skips_active_profile`)
  survived the merge and now passes. Closes `ERR-2026-09-10-001` (HIGH). Path:
  `hermes_cli/main.py`. Run: RUN-2026-09-10-003.

- **CHG-2026-09-10-004** — **`scripts/lib/report_completeness.py`: the mandatory
  closing `Handoff bundle:` line must carry real values before a report counts as
  complete.** `RUN-2026-09-10-001` and `-002` were handed over with
  `Handoff bundle: HANDOFF_2026-09-10_PLACEHOLDER.zip (sha256: PLACEHOLDER) -
  created.` — the chicken-and-egg workaround (the zip contains the report) left
  the template token in the copy that shipped. New `check_handoff_line()`, called
  per covered run: a report (dated `2026-09-10` or later) with **no**
  `Handoff bundle:` line, or one whose zip name still contains `PLACEHOLDER` /
  isn't `HANDOFF_<YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM>.zip`, or whose `sha256` isn't 64 hex, is now a
  **FAIL** — so `collect-logs.{ps1,sh}` (which both delegate here) will not report
  `COMPLETE`. `- NOT created (reason)` is accepted; the check reads the **last**
  `Handoff bundle:` line in the body with fenced ``` blocks stripped first (a
  report that quotes the line format is not tripped by it), and inspects only the
  zip-name and sha capture groups, so a parenthetical that uses the word
  "placeholder" in prose does not trip it either. Reports dated `2026-09-09` and
  earlier (written before the owner's standing rule) are not retroactively failed
  for a missing line. `SESSION-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md` gains the line as a filled-in
  skeleton with a "never leave PLACEHOLDER" note; `logs/ledger/README.md`
  "End-of-task handoff" documents the requirement and the hash-back-fill
  resolution to the chicken-and-egg. `+tests/test_report_completeness_handoff_line.py`
  (7). Paths: `scripts/lib/report_completeness.py`,
  `logs/ledger/templates/SESSION-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md`, `logs/ledger/README.md`,
  `tests/test_report_completeness_handoff_line.py`. Run: RUN-2026-09-10-003.

## [NF-v0.10.0] — 2026-09-10 — hermes@0e9fc2cc15 (0 behind upstream/main)

**`RUN-2026-09-10-001` — completed and landed the North Forge Full-tier
in-session admin trigger: a Full-tier operator can type the drive's admin
passcode as a bare message in a running session to open the same
`scripts/nf-setup.ps1` reconfiguration (tier / pin / edition) nf-setup already
provides, without exiting and without a re-provision-from-scratch cycle.**
**MINOR** — a new North Forge admin capability on top of upstream; no schema or
engine change. `DECISION-2026-09-10-001` (opened + decided same run,
owner-directed): the trigger stands as designed — a bare-token passcode on an
active Full-tier drive, silent on every other input.

**`RUN-2026-09-10-002` (drive-maintenance pass) rebased this block onto
`origin/main`.** `CHG-2026-09-10-001` was first committed to local `main` on base
`hermes@0e9fc2cc15` (`NF-v0.9.0` HEAD `bb64aab4f3`); the next session
`git pull --rebase`d it (and `RUN-2026-09-10-002`'s own `CHG-2026-09-10-002`)
onto `origin/main` `23135479a2` — a +163 `NousResearch:main` sync — **0
conflicts**; `tests/test_nf_admin.py` re-run **17 passed** on the rebased tree.
`main` is now `+2 ahead / 0 behind` `origin/main`, **still not pushed** — the
push is a separate owner-authorised step, and the two commits are also backed up
at `D:\NF-v0.10.0-BACKUP_2026-09-10\` (branch `nf-v0.10.0-hold`, tag, thin
bundle, `format-patch` series). `ERR-2026-09-10-001` **reconfirmed present** on
`origin/main` `23135479a2` after the rebase — the +163 sync did not carry the
fix.

The feature arrived this run as an **uncommitted work-in-progress** (classifier
+ CLI wiring already written, referencing an unwritten `CHG-2026-09-09-004`).
Completing it: (1) **the launch path was non-functional** — `run_nf_reconfig_and_resume`
shelled `nf-setup.ps1` with no `-Force`, so `nf_tier.write_provisioning` got
`overwrite=False` and refused every already-provisioned drive with "already
exists — pass --force" (the only drive this trigger can fire on). Added `-Force`;
nf-setup.ps1 still prompts for and verifies the admin passcode itself, so auth is
unchanged — `-Force` only lifts the overwrite guard, and this is nf-setup.ps1's
own documented RE-PROVISION path. (2) `maybe_recognize_admin_phrase` gained a
test-only `root=` override mirroring every `nf_tier` entry point. (3) The
placeholder id was reassigned `CHG-2026-09-09-004` → `CHG-2026-09-10-001` per the
daily-`NNN`-reset rule (same as the `NF-v0.8.2` earmark reassignment).

Found in passing, **not fixed here** (access-tier code, and pre-existing on
`origin/main`): `ERR-2026-09-10-001` — a merge dropped `def _desktop_ssh_backend`
from `hermes_cli/main.py` while keeping its call in `_apply_profile_override`, so
`import hermes_cli.main` raises `NameError` on an unprovisioned or Full-tier
drive. Flagged for the owner; one-line verbatim restore from `677e8ed8a4`.

Verification (Windows-native, `.venv` pytest, `TZ=UTC PYTHONHASHSEED=0`):
`tests/test_nf_admin.py` **17 passed** (new — silent-path / recognised-hit /
mismatch-logged / wrong-shape-never-hashed / tampered-record / never-raises, plus
a `windows_only` check that the launch path passes `-Force`);
`tests/test_nf_tier_enforcement.py` **29 passed, 1 failed** — the single failure
(`test_integration_full_defaults_to_pin_but_switches`) is `ERR-2026-09-10-001`
above, reproduced on the untouched tree, not this change. `ruff check` clean on
the new/changed files.

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-10-001** — **North Forge Full-tier in-session admin trigger.**
  New `hermes_cli/nf_admin.py`: `maybe_recognize_admin_phrase(text, root=None)`
  classifies a submitted line and returns `"open"` only when the drive is
  `STATE_ACTIVE` + `TIER_FULL`, an admin passcode is set, and *text* is exactly
  it (a whitespace-free 6–128-char token — the shape of a passcode attempt, so
  normal multi-word chat is skipped without hashing). Every other input —
  unprovisioned, Basic tier, plain upstream Hermes, wrong value, wrong shape —
  returns `None` and routes as normal chat with **zero observable difference**.
  Verification reuses `nf_tier.verify_admin_passcode` (the PBKDF2 check
  `nf-setup.ps1` uses at build time); no tier/pin/edition logic is duplicated
  into the CLI. A recognised hit (`reconfig-opened`) and a plausible miss on a
  Full drive (`passcode-mismatch`) are appended to
  `<nf-root>/north-forge/admin-attempts.log` via `nf_tier.log_admin_attempt` for
  the owner — timestamped, tab-separated, **the passcode is never written**.
  `run_nf_reconfig_and_resume()` runs `scripts/nf-setup.ps1 -Force` on the main
  thread after prompt_toolkit tears down (real terminal), then re-execs `hermes`
  — the same deferral `/update` uses. `cli.py` sets `_pending_nf_reconfig` in
  `__init__`, calls `_maybe_handle_nf_admin_phrase()` in the interactive input
  path (after `handle_bang_shell`, before slash-command dispatch; skipped for
  seeded `-q` queries), and dispatches the reconfig next to the `_pending_relaunch`
  handling in `run()`. `hermes_cli/nf_tier.py` adds `admin_attempt_log_path()` +
  `log_admin_attempt()` (append-only, `chmod 600`, never raises).
  Paths: `hermes_cli/nf_admin.py`, `hermes_cli/nf_tier.py`, `cli.py`,
  `hermes_cli/cli_commands_mixin.py`, `tests/test_nf_admin.py`.
  Ref: DECISION-2026-09-10-001; ERR-2026-09-10-001 (found in passing, not fixed).
  Run: RUN-2026-09-10-001.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-10-002** — **Branding drift correction: README, translations, and
  the tease page now lead with North Forge as the identity, with Hermes Agent
  credited as the engine it is *built on* — not as what North Forge *is*.** The
  user-facing lead copy had drifted to *"North Forge … **is** [Hermes Agent] …
  carrying a North Forge identity"* and *"a … chassis **on top of** the Hermes
  engine"*, framing North Forge as Hermes wearing a skin. Corrected to *"North
  Forge is an AI agent you can make your own … It is **built on** Hermes Agent"*.
  `README.md`: H1 tagline, lead paragraph, the "learning loop" paragraph
  (`The engine brings…` → `From that engine North Forge inherits…`), the CLI-vs-
  Messaging intro (`Hermes has two entry points` → `North Forge has…`), the
  Documentation intro, and the OpenClaw-migration line (`Hermes can import` →
  `North Forge can`). `README.es.md` / `README.zh-CN.md` / `README.ur-pk.md`:
  the lead predicate noun (`chassis` / `底座` / `چیسس` → "an AI agent you can make
  your own"); these already used a "built on the engine" construction, so only the
  noun changed. `docs/preview.html`: `<title>`, `<meta description>`, hero `<h1>`
  (`A brandable AI-agent chassis` → `An AI agent you can make your own`), hero
  sub, and the "what it is" lead — plus **three stale `used unmodified` phrasings**
  that contradicted `DECISION-2026-09-07-002` (which had tightened exactly that
  wording elsewhere) were aligned to *"keeps the engine's functional behavior;
  changes are identity, presentation, and workflow"*. **Attribution unchanged and
  intact**: the `hermes` command name and `hermes …` examples, the "Engine by
  Nous Research" / "Engine docs" badges, the docs-table links to
  `hermes-agent.nousresearch.com`, the `pyproject.toml` `hermes-agent`
  distribution name, and the dual `LICENSE` copyright lines are all deliberate
  category-2/3 surfaces per `BRANDING.md` and were left as-is. `NF-vX.Y.Z`
  versioning was already North-Forge-first. **PATCH** (docs only). Paths:
  `README.md`, `README.es.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `README.ur-pk.md`,
  `docs/preview.html`. Ref: `BRANDING.md` §1 (README lead = North-Forge-owned);
  consistent with `DECISION-2026-09-06-001` / `DECISION-2026-09-07-002`.
  Run: RUN-2026-09-10-002.

## [NF-v0.9.0] — 2026-09-09 — hermes@0e9fc2cc15 (0 behind upstream/main)

**`RUN-2026-09-09-002` — `DECISION-2026-09-09-001` decided + implemented same
run: a North Forge drive can now carry its own Python toolchain, so
`bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` builds its venv with nothing on the recipient's
`PATH` and no network.** **MINOR** — new drive-provisioning capability + a new
admin workflow, on top of upstream; no schema or engine change, no change to R1.
Committed on base `hermes@a60c74b52a` (`NF-v0.8.2` HEAD), then
`git pull --rebase origin main` and pushed. `DECISION-2026-09-09-001`: chose
**B** — bundle `uv.exe` + a `python-build-standalone` CPython 3.11 as a
**never-git-tracked drive sibling `<parent>\<leaf>-toolchain\`**, admin-prepared
once and copied per drive (not fetched at first-launch, not git/LFS). Feasibility
groundwork: `D:\logs\CODEX-BUNDLED-PYTHON-FEASIBILITY.md`.

Verification (Windows-native, `scripts/run_tests.sh` targeted):
`test_bootstrap_north_forge_path_safety` 29 (25 pre-existing + 4 toolchain, incl.
a **zero-PATH bundled build** — real uv staged + a junction to a
`python-build-standalone` CPython, `PATH` scrubbed to System32),
`test_bootstrap_launcher_hardening` 15, `test_nf_preflight_readiness` 10,
`test_session_listing` 18. No regression in R1's state-matrix. Full `run_tests.sh`
not run — same standing reason (`.git/index.lock` contention + the pre-existing
`tests/acp/**` · `tests/agent/**` baseline).

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-09-003** — **Drive-native bundled Python toolchain: `bootstrap`
  resolves a shipped toolchain before it ever looks at `PATH`.** New
  `scripts/lib/nf-toolchain.ps1` — a **read-only** resolver `Get-NfBundledToolchain`
  (+ `Test-NfExecutable`) that locates `<parent>\<leaf>-toolchain\uv\uv.exe` and
  `\python\python.exe` (a sibling of the checkout, mirroring `-venv` / `-data`),
  sanity-checks both are present non-empty `.exe`s, and returns
  `{ Root; UvExe; PyExe; Present }`. It never downloads, writes, deletes, exits,
  or emits. `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` dot-sources it alongside
  `nf-readiness.ps1` / `nf-venv-state.ps1` and its venv-creation branch now
  resolves the toolchain **bundled first, host `PATH` second**:
  1. bundled `uv` + bundled interpreter → `uv venv --python <bundled python.exe>`
     (fully offline, no `PATH`, no uv-managed download);
  2. `uv` present (bundled or host) but no bundled interpreter →
     `uv venv --python 3.11` *(unchanged from before)*;
  3. no `uv` → host `python -m venv` *(unchanged)*;
  4. nothing → `"No 'uv' and no 'python' on PATH. Install Python 3.11+ or uv, then
     re-run."` **verbatim, unchanged.**
  Every run logs a stable `[bootstrap] toolchain uv=<bundled|host|none>
  python=<...> bundled_root=<path>` line; a `PATH` fallback is additionally
  logged `using host toolchain (admin/dev)` so it is never silently confused
  with the bundled path. The `UV_CACHE_DIR` volume-pin now keys on the resolved
  uv (`$uvExe`) rather than a bare `Get-Command uv`. **No change to R1**: the
  `-toolchain` folder is an *input* to venv creation, a fourth sibling that never
  overlaps the checkout / venv / data dir; `nf-venv-state.ps1` (ownership) and
  `nf-readiness.ps1` (readiness) never look at it, and the
  create/rebuild/refuse/`none` state table is entirely upstream of toolchain
  resolution — a `-Force` rebuild still deletes only `-venv`. New
  `docs/BUILDING-A-DRIVE.md` (the one-time admin toolchain-prep + per-drive copy)
  and `docs/toolchain/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` (CPython/PSF, uv Apache-2.0-or-MIT,
  python-build-standalone — copied into each drive's toolchain folder). Tests:

  `test_no_toolchain_anywhere_gives_the_exact_existing_error`,
  `test_toolchain_resolver_source_is_read_only_and_not_ownership_evidence`); the
  R1 fake-repo helpers in `test_bootstrap_north_forge_path_safety.py` and
  `test_bootstrap_launcher_hardening.py` now also copy `nf-toolchain.ps1`. Paths:

## [NF-v0.8.2] — 2026-09-09 — hermes@0e9fc2cc15 (0 behind upstream/main — rebased onto origin/main)

**`RUN-2026-09-09-001` — landed two AGENT-D changes that were code-complete and
locally verified but never committed** (recovered from a `hermes-update`
autostash dated 2026-09-09 01:42): the **R1** bootstrap venv-cleanup rework and
the `session_listing.py` adaptive-widening fix that `RUN-2026-09-08-005` scoped
and carried forward. Each is its own commit with its own `CHG-`/`ERR-`.
**PATCH** — reliability fixes to launcher/bootstrap tooling and a CLI listing
path; no new capability, no schema or engine change. Committed on base
`hermes@3e0ddfb05d` (`NF-v0.8.1` HEAD), then `git pull --rebase origin main` — the
2 code commits rebased **0 conflicts** over a +26-commit `origin/main` advance and
then a second advance (`f12feace3a` → `4d2bb83617`, PR #22/#23/#24 + an upstream
`Merge branch 'main'`) that arrived between rebase and push; no incoming commit
touches any of the changed files. Pushed. Base coordinate stamped at the rebase.

Opened + resolved same run: `ERR-2026-09-09-001`, `ERR-2026-09-09-002` (both
R1), `ERR-2026-09-09-003` (session listing). AGENT D's own notes
(`D:\logs\NORTH-FORGE-R1-VENV-CLEANUP_2026-09-09.md`,
`D:\logs\SESSION-LISTING-ADAPTIVE-WIDENING_2026-09-09.md`) had provisionally
earmarked `ERR-2026-09-08-013/014` + `CHG-2026-09-08-026/027`; reassigned to
today's sequence per the "`NNN` resets each day" rule (README § Naming).

Verification (on the rebased tree, `scripts/run_tests.sh` targeted):
`test_bootstrap_north_forge_path_safety` 25 (14 pre-existing + 11 R1),
`test_nf_preflight_readiness` 10, `test_bootstrap_launcher_hardening` 15
(13 + 2 R1 direct-path), `test_session_listing` 18 (13 + 5). **68/68.** A full
`run_tests.sh` was not run — same reason as `RUN-2026-09-08-004/005`
(`.git/index.lock` contention + a large pre-existing `tests/acp/**` ·
`tests/agent/**` failure baseline unrelated to any changed file).

### Fixed

- **CHG-2026-09-09-001** — **`bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` is now the single,
  ownership-gated authority for cleaning the sibling venv directory.** It decided
  "already bootstrapped?" from a bare `hermes.exe` + `.nf-bootstrapped` existence
  check and, under `-Force`, ran `Remove-Item -Recurse` on `$VenvDir` whenever
  that path merely existed — so a partial, interrupted, or entirely unrelated
  directory at `<checkout>-venv` was either silently trusted as a venv
  (`ERR-2026-09-09-001`) or destroyed, with no proof North Forge created it; and
  `-VenvDir` / `-DataDir`, each checked against the checkout, were never checked
  against **each other**, so an overlapping pair let a `-Force` rebuild delete
  `HERMES_HOME` (`ERR-2026-09-09-002`). New `scripts/lib/nf-venv-state.ps1` — a
  pure, read-only classifier `Get-NfVenvState` (states `Absent` /
  `EmptyDirectory` / `OwnedNorthForgeVenv` / `RecognizablePythonVenv` /
  `UnknownDirectory` / `UnsafePath`; evidence order: a readable `.nf-bootstrapped`
  `repo=` line, matching or foreign, then a `pyvenv.cfg` that actually parses;
  anything else is `UnknownDirectory`) that never deletes, writes, exits, or
  emits. `bootstrap` runs that classifier and `Test-NfVenvReady` as **separate**
  decisions and drives a `create` / `rebuild` / `refuse` / `none` state table:
  `UnknownDirectory` and `UnsafePath` are refused unconditionally — `-Force` is a
  rebuild *request*, never a deletion override — `EmptyDirectory` is populated in
  place, and the one `Remove-Item` is immediately preceded (nothing in between) by
  a re-check of the canonical path and ownership. Every decision logs a stable
  `venv_state= ownership= action= reason=` line. The skin seed into the data
  folder now runs only on a first-time `create`, never on a `rebuild` — a repair
  does not touch `HERMES_HOME` at all. `nf-preflight.ps1` no longer derives
  `-Force` from `python.exe` existence or labels the venv; on a failed probe it
  just requests a repair (`action=bootstrap-repair`,
  `result=repair-ok | repair-incomplete | repair-refused-or-failed`). The existing
  RepoRoot overlap guards, `Test-PathOverlap`, and `Get-CanonicalDir` are
  byte-unchanged. Paths: `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`,
  `scripts/nf-preflight.ps1`, `scripts/lib/nf-venv-state.ps1`,
  `tests/test_bootstrap_north_forge_path_safety.py`,

  `tests/test_nf_preflight_readiness.py`. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-09-001`,
  `ERR-2026-09-09-002`. Run: RUN-2026-09-09-001.

- **CHG-2026-09-09-002** — **`query_session_listing` widens its DB fetch
  adaptively so the post-fetch visibility filter can't hide older eligible
  sessions.** It fetched one fixed `limit * 4` window from `list_sessions_rich`,
  then filtered unnamed / current-session rows in Python — enough newer unnamed
  sessions in that window pushed an older *named*, displayable session out of the
  fetch entirely and it never showed (the same shape as the `hermes logs`
  sparse-match bug `ERR-2026-09-08-008`; `ERR-2026-09-09-003`). Now `limit <= 0`
  returns `[]` before any query, and the fetch widens `limit * (4, 8, 16)` —
  always from row 0, never `OFFSET` pagination, so a concurrent insert can't skip
  or double a row — stopping as soon as `limit` displayable rows survive the
  filter or the DB returns a short window. 16× is the ceiling; the two callers
  pass `limit` 10/50, so the widest fetch is a few hundred rows from one indexed
  query, and no session-count clamp exists on this path (none was invented). The
  existing filter is factored out to `_displayable()`; SQL scoping, search
  behaviour, `ORDER BY`, and the "never exceeds `limit`" guarantee are unchanged.
  This is the `session_listing.py` sparse-match hardening scoped but not started
  in `RUN-2026-09-08-005`. Paths: `hermes_cli/session_listing.py`,
  `tests/hermes_cli/test_session_listing.py`. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-09-003`.

## [NF-v0.8.1] — 2026-09-08 — hermes@c076d653a2 (0 behind upstream/main — rebased onto origin/main)

**`RUN-2026-09-08-005` — consolidated commit pass: two batches of small
correctness fixes landed together in dependency order, one session.** These are
the "reconciliation-corrections" batch (the handler-registration race + its
review corrections, the shared Windows subprocess env, the `windows_only`
discovery fix) and the "focused-correctness" batch (`HERMES_HOME`-aware worktree
archive, cross-platform testing policy, record-aware log filtering) plus the
remaining pre-existing local work (cron empty-map persist, model-guard
fail-closed, voice comment, timezone-cache race). Each is its own commit with its
own `CHG-`/`ERR-`. **PATCH** — fixes, test infra, docs; no new capability, no
schema or engine change. Committed per-`CHG-` on local `main` on base
`hermes@7ee2b69151`, then `git pull --rebase origin main` and pushed. Base
coordinate stamped at the rebase.

Opened + resolved same run: `ERR-2026-09-08-005`..`-011`. Opened and left **OPEN**
(deliberately not fixed, its own item): `ERR-2026-09-08-012` (`nf-setup.ps1`
null-`$LASTEXITCODE` → `"Provisioning failed (exit )"` — fails safe; access-tier
code, escalated). `session_listing.py` sparse-match hardening was **scoped but not
started** this run (read-only inspection only) — carried forward.

Verification: targeted suites green — `test_hermes_logging` 28 pass / 1 skip / **2
pre-existing fails** (`test_profile_routing_follows_context_home`,
`test_managed_mode_initial_open_sets_group_writable` — managed-mode/Windows lane,
reproduced on a clean tree, not from this work), `test_hermes_time_cache` 2,
`test_bootstrap_launcher_hardening` 13, `test_nf_tier_enforcement` 30 (incl. the
now-`windows_only` PS drive, executed on this win32 host), `test_worktree_gc` 17,
`test_logs` 26, `test_jobs` 113, `test_auth_model_picker_guards` 4,
`test_list_os_marked_tests` + `test_os_marker_gating` 13. A full
`scripts/run_tests.sh` was started but stopped (it contends with concurrent git
ops for the index lock, and the fork carries a large pre-existing failure baseline
in `tests/acp/` / `tests/agent/**` unrelated to any file in this batch — 26 fails
in the first ~9% before it was stopped, none in a changed file or a file importing
a changed module).

### Fixed

- **CHG-2026-09-08-017** — **Queued-handler dedup + registration made atomic under
  `_queue_state_lock`.** `hermes_logging._add_rotating_handler()` scanned
  `_queued_file_handlers` for the resolved log path **outside** the lock, then
  appended **inside** it — two `setup_logging()` callers on different threads
  (gateway init vs a CLI/plugin path; `setup_logging` takes no lock and its
  `_logging_initialized` guard runs after registration) could both pass the scan
  and each append a live `RotatingFileHandler` for the same file (duplicate lines,
  two fds, two handlers racing one rotation). Extracted `_handler_covers_path()`
  (moved above `_register_queued_handler` per review); the pre-check now runs
  under the lock, and `_register_queued_handler(handler, dedup_path=…)` re-checks
  under the lock before appending — the register-or-not decision and the append
  are one critical section via a `duplicate` flag, and the losing handler is
  closed **after** the lock is released (thread-local, unreferenced). Also closes
  a latent mutation-during-iteration race vs `enable_profile_log_routing()`.
  `tests/test_hermes_logging.py::test_concurrent_add_for_same_path_registers_one_handler`
  forces the interleave with a `Barrier`, runs the workers on a
  `ThreadPoolExecutor` so a worker exception surfaces via `future.result()`.
  Corrected per an independent review (lock scope; worker-exception visibility).
  Paths: `hermes_logging.py`, `tests/test_hermes_logging.py`. Ref:
  `ERR-2026-09-08-005`. Run: RUN-2026-09-08-005.

- **CHG-2026-09-08-019** — **Worktree GC archives reclaimed scratch under
  `HERMES_HOME`, not a hardcoded `~/.hermes`.** `worktree_gc._archive_untracked()`
  copied untracked files out of a doomed tree to
  `Path.home()/".hermes"/"archive"/"worktree-prune"`, ignoring the active
  `HERMES_HOME` / profile / a managed or relocated home. Now
  `get_hermes_home()/"archive"/"worktree-prune"/<tree>-<stamp>`
  (`from hermes_constants import get_hermes_home`, stdlib-only). The copy loop, the
  `None`-on-failure contract, and `reclaim_worktrees()`'s "archive is `None` ⇒ keep
  the tree" fail-safe are unchanged. Test fixture (real git, no mocks) now sets
  `HOME` / `USERPROFILE` / `HERMES_HOME` to three temp dirs; asserts the archive is
  under `$HERMES_HOME`, **not** under `~/.hermes`, contents byte-identical, archive
  precedes removal; new `test_archive_failure_keeps_worktree_and_files` (real
  `mkdir` failure via `HERMES_HOME`→a file) proves the tree is kept and files
  intact. Paths: `hermes_cli/worktree_gc.py`, `tests/hermes_cli/test_worktree_gc.py`.

- **CHG-2026-09-08-021** — **Record-aware `hermes logs` filtering** (closes two
  bugs with one implementation). `hermes logs -n N --level/--session/--component/--since`:
  (A) the filtered path over-read only `max(N*20, 2000)` lines from the tail —
  3 `ERROR` records behind 2001 `INFO` lines returned nothing; (B) per-line
  filtering leaked a rejected record's continuation lines (level/since pass a
  line with no header) and dropped a matched record's continuation lines
  (session/component fail them). New `_iter_records()` groups `(header|None,
  [lines])`; `_matches_filters()` runs on the **header** only; a record is kept or
  dropped whole. Filtered `_read_tail` now **streams the whole file once**, keeping
  the last N matching records in `deque(maxlen=N)` — O(N records) memory, scan
  bounded by log rotation (default 5 MB); no repo session-count safety limit
  exists and none was invented. Unfiltered path unchanged (plain last-N-lines
  tail). New `_FollowFilter` gives `-f` the same record-inheritance. `-n N`
  preserved as "the last N" — N raw lines unfiltered, N whole matching records
  filtered (header never sliced); run header reads `last N matching`.
  `web_routers/status.py::get_logs` (the other `_read_tail` caller) post-filters
  and trims, unaffected. `+12` tests. Paths: `hermes_cli/logs.py`,
  `tests/hermes_cli/test_logs.py`. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-08-008`. Run: RUN-2026-09-08-005.

- **CHG-2026-09-08-022** — **`cron.load_jobs()` persists the canonical
  `{"jobs": []}` shape even when the repaired list is empty.** The write-back guard
  was `if jobs and repair:` — an empty legacy id-keyed map / bare list was
  normalised in memory but never rewritten, so every load re-ran the repair path.
  Now `if repair:`. `tests/cron/test_jobs.py`: the empty-map test asserts the file
  is rewritten and a second load is idempotent. Paths: `cron/jobs.py`,
  `tests/cron/test_jobs.py`. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-08-009`. Run: RUN-2026-09-08-005.

- **CHG-2026-09-08-023** — **`auth_model_picker._confirm_selection_guards()` fails
  closed on an unexpected guard-registry error.** It caught every exception from
  `model_selection_guards` and treated it as "no warnings" — an unexpected error
  silently let an unvetted model change through. Now a non-`ImportError` exception
  is `logger.exception(…)`'d with context, the user is told the model was not
  changed, and it returns `False`; `ImportError` (feature not built in) still
  returns `True`. New `tests/hermes_cli/test_auth_model_picker_guards.py` (4).

  `tests/hermes_cli/test_auth_model_picker_guards.py`. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-08-010`.
  Run: RUN-2026-09-08-005.

- **CHG-2026-09-08-025** — **`hermes_time.get_timezone()` retries when the cache
  identity shifts mid-resolve.** It captured the cache identity, resolved the zone
  name outside the lock (config I/O), then published `(name, tz)` under the
  captured identity — a profile / `HERMES_TIMEZONE` switch during that I/O (now
  genuinely concurrent under tier/pin) poisoned the pre-switch slot or returned
  the wrong profile's zone. Now the resolve-and-publish is a loop that re-reads
  `_timezone_cache_identity()` after the resolve and retries on a shift. New
  `tests/test_hermes_time_cache.py` (2). Paths: `hermes_time.py`,
  `tests/test_hermes_time_cache.py`. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-08-011`. Run: RUN-2026-09-08-005.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-08-024** — **`hermes_cli/voice.py` — comment-only.**
  `normalize_voice_record_key_for_prompt_toolkit()`'s existing
  `else _DEFAULT_PT_KEY` fallback for an unknown multi-char key token was
  under-explained; the comment now names the `test_voice_wrapper` case
  (`format_voice_record_key_for_status("ctrl+spcae")`) that pins it. No behaviour
  change. Paths: `hermes_cli/voice.py`. Ref: —. Run: RUN-2026-09-08-005.

### Documentation

- **CHG-2026-09-08-020** — **`CONTRIBUTING.md` cross-platform testing policy.**
  "Run tests": mandate `scripts/run_tests.sh`, never bare `pytest` (records the
  "works locally / fails in CI" history), plus a scoped-run example. "Testing
  cross-platform": `excercise`→`exercise`; state that OS-dependent behaviour must
  be tested on that actual OS behind one canonical host-OS marker
  (`linux_only`/`macos_only`/`windows_only`), and that the marker is what puts the
  file in the CI lane's import set (`scripts/ci/list_os_marked_tests.py`) while
  `conftest` skips it off-host; **remove** the "if you monkeypatch `sys.platform`,
  also patch `platform.system()`/`.release()`/`.mac_ver()`" advice, replace with a
  hard prohibition on faking process-global host identity; add: extract a pure
  decision function taking platform facts as args and keep the real `platform.*`
  call site thin behind a marked test. Paths: `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Ref: —. Run:
  RUN-2026-09-08-005.

### Test infrastructure

- **CHG-2026-09-08-018** — **Shared `minimal_windows_subprocess_env()`; `nf-setup.ps1`
  drive test marked `@pytest.mark.windows_only`.** `tests/test_nf_tier_enforcement.py`
  gated its `nf-setup.ps1` integration test with a module-level
  `_WINDOWS_ONLY = skipif(sys.platform != "win32")`; `scripts/ci/list_os_marked_tests.py`
  scopes the CI Windows lane's import set by whole-word match on `windows_only`, so
  a bare `skipif` never matched and the file was **not imported by the Windows
  lane** — the test effectively never ran in CI (`ERR-2026-09-08-006`). Replaced
  with `@pytest.mark.windows_only` (`conftest` still skips off-`win32`); the file
  now appears in the lane list. Separately, the `_minimal_win_env()` helper that
  existed verbatim in two test files is promoted to
  `tests/_windows_env.py::minimal_windows_subprocess_env()` (identical body +
  fallback semantics); both files import it, and the now-unused `import os` is
  removed from `tests/test_bootstrap_launcher_hardening.py`. Test-only;
  `scripts/nf-setup.ps1` unchanged. Paths: `tests/_windows_env.py`,
  `tests/test_nf_tier_enforcement.py`, `tests/test_bootstrap_launcher_hardening.py`.

## [NF-v0.8.0] — 2026-09-08 — hermes@c076d653a2 (0 behind upstream/main — rebased onto origin/main)

**`RUN-2026-09-08-004` — full hygiene / cleanup pass + a second Codex
progress-check batch, one session.** Close every genuinely-open ledger item and
land the `CODEX-PROGRESS-CHECK-2026-09-08.md` findings (report supplied in the run
prompt; not on disk this session). Started level with `origin/main` on
`hermes@85518051ed`-era base `520e63661c`; between committing and pushing,
`origin/main` advanced +33 (a `NousResearch:main` merge `8409e486d8` — desktop /
bot-mode / gateway work + `fmt(js)` + a copilot GH-Actions fix). The 7 NF commits
rebased **clean, 0 conflicts** — none of the 33 origin-only commits touch any file
in `CHG-2026-09-08-008..016` (verified with `git rev-list --count <mb>..origin/main
-- <file>` = 0 for every one). Coordinates stamped at the rebase:
`hermes@c076d653a2`, 0 behind `upstream/main`. **MINOR** — new tooling / skill surface
(`scripts/lib/report_completeness.py`, the report manifest + workflow, the
`pbf-canon` skill) alongside the fixes. Committed per-CHG and pushed.

Closed this pass: `ERR-2026-09-07-004`, `ERR-2026-09-07-007` (filename half),
`DECISION-2026-09-07-002`; opened + resolved same run: `ERR-2026-09-08-001..004`
(Codex `PC-2026-09-08-001..005`). `ERR-2026-09-06-001` (the live `.env` key)
**left untouched** — accepted, owner-decided, time-limited risk. End-of-pass
`collect-logs.ps1` self-check: **COMPLETE, 0 FAIL, 1 WARN** — the WARN is 9
uncommitted files from a separate concurrent pass (`CONTRIBUTING.md`,
`cron/jobs.py`, `hermes_time.py`, `hermes_cli/{voice,auth_model_picker}.py`, +
tests), deliberately not staged here.

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-08-008** — **Relational RUN-to-report completeness check**
  (closes `ERR-2026-09-07-004` / Codex F-02 / R-01). The old check in
  `scripts/collect-logs.{ps1,sh}` proved only "a report exists dated ≥ the newest
  ledger id" — one same-day report made every run that day look covered, and a
  report could omit its `RUN-` id entirely. New `scripts/lib/report_completeness.py`
  (stdlib; invoked by both collectors so the PS and POSIX paths stay identical)
  requires **every `RUN-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` id in the ledger** to have a row in the new
  `logs/ledger/reports/REPORT-MANIFEST.md` (run id · report basename · covered
  `CHG-`/`ERR-`/`DECISION-` ids · source-of-truth · sha256), and that row to name
  a session report present in the out-dir **and** mentioning that run id — else
  an explicit `ledger-only` disposition. A run with no row, a row naming a missing
  or wrong report ⇒ **FAIL** (not WARN). Also emits WARNs for a sha256 drift, a
  stale manifest row, and an unresolved ledger `[[wiki-link]]`. New
  `logs/ledger/templates/SESSION-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md` carries the required
  `Run:` / `Covers:` / `Source-Of-Truth:` header. The four recent runs that had
  changed the ledger but left no report (`RUN-2026-09-07-011`,
  `RUN-2026-09-08-001` / `-002` / `-003`) were **backfilled** with proper reports.
  `collect-logs.{ps1,sh}` §5 rewritten to call the validator and map its lines to
  checks. Paths: `scripts/lib/report_completeness.py`,

- **CHG-2026-09-08-012** — **Document the GUI installer in the README install
  section** (the `CHG-2026-09-08-001` note said "unmentioned in docs until it
  lands on `origin/main`" — it has now landed and pushed). `README.md` § "Quick
  Install" restructured: **North Forge Setup** (`North-Forge-Setup.exe`,
  double-click, no terminal) is the recommended path for a non-technical
  recipient; the `north-forge.cmd` launcher is now the "advanced / no GUI"
  secondary path; the shared drive-native explanation was hoisted above both. The
  `.exe` behaviour described matches the shipped app (drive/folder picker that

- **CHG-2026-09-08-015** — **`editions/pine-barron-farms` canon loader** (closes
  `ERR-2026-09-08-003` / Codex `PC-2026-09-08-004`). `SOUL.md` claimed *"I follow
  the loaded canon packet exactly"* while nothing read
  `canon/PINE_BARRON_FARMS_CANON.md`. New `editions/pine-barron-farms/canon/load_canon.py`
  (standard library; **exit 0 always** — a missing packet is a state, not an
  error) resolves the packet (explicit dir → profile `canon/` → `HERMES_HOME` →
  skill-relative) and prints either a `canon loaded: <path>, sha256=<hex>, <n>
  bytes` receipt followed by the packet between `--- BEGIN/END PINE BARRON FARMS
  CANON ---` markers (truncated to a budget with a "read the full file" pointer
  when it does not fit), or a `WARNING: canon packet NOT FOUND` message naming
  every path checked and stating that only the SOUL.md persona/method are in
  force. Loaded two **existing-mechanism, no-engine-change** ways: a session-start
  command mandated by `SOUL.md` (*"before my first substantive reply … run
  `python canon/load_canon.py` … treat its output as canon"*), and the new
  `editions/pine-barron-farms/skills/pbf-canon/SKILL.md` skill (its body — the
  loader invocation and how to read the output — assembles into the
  preloaded-skills system prompt). `distribution.yaml` ships the loader + skill
  (`distribution_owned`), so `hermes profile update` refreshes them but never the
  deploy-time packet. `canon/README.md` documents the mechanism.
  `tests/test_pbf_canon_loader.py` (6): present / absent / truncation-with-pointer

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-08-010** — **Soften the overstated rebrand wording** (implements
  `DECISION-2026-09-07-002` Option A). *"engine used unmodified"* /
  *"whatever Hermes Agent does, North Forge does"* replaced with
  *"North Forge keeps Hermes Agent's functional engine behavior; its downstream
  changes are identity, presentation, and workflow only"* in `README.md` (the
  lead paragraph **and** the provenance paragraph), `README.es.md`,
  `README.zh-CN.md`, `README.ur-pk.md`, and `BRANDING.md` (the intro **and** the
  category-3 note). `BRANDING.md`'s intro now also names the visible CLI strings
  that stay Hermes on purpose (the `hermes` command + its examples, `HERMES_HOME`
  paths, `HERMES_AGENT_HELP_GUIDANCE`, the `agent_name` skin fallback, the
  OS-service descriptions, upstream's setup/update/uninstall copy). No identifier
  churn. Paths: `README.md`, `README.es.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `README.ur-pk.md`,
  `BRANDING.md`. Ref: `DECISION-2026-09-07-002`. Run: RUN-2026-09-08-004.

- **CHG-2026-09-08-011** — **North-Forge-leading sweep of two visible CLI
  strings** (the surfaces Codex F-07 / `DECISION-2026-09-07-002` named as still
  Hermes). `cli.py` interactive `_welcome_text` fallback
  *"Welcome to Hermes Agent!"* → *"Welcome to North Forge!"* (matches
  `skins/north-forge.yaml`'s `branding.welcome`, which drives the live path).
  `hermes_cli/_parser.py` `chat` subparser `description`
  *"Start an interactive chat session with Hermes Agent"* → *"… with North Forge
  (on the Hermes Agent engine)."* — North Forge leads, Hermes stays as honest
  attribution (same hierarchy as the `DEFAULT_SOUL_MD` line and the top-level
  parser). A fresh grep for a *leading* "Hermes Agent" product name turned up only
  these two on user-visible runtime surfaces; the rest are category 2 (engine
  internals / command names) or 3 (upstream docstrings / how-to copy) and stay.
  Both added to `BRANDING.md` category 1. Paths: `cli.py`,

- **CHG-2026-09-08-014** — **Installer: one shared checkout validator + a
  no-silent-pick autodetect** (closes `ERR-2026-09-08-002` / Codex
  `PC-2026-09-08-002` + `-003`). `apps/bootstrap-installer`'s Rust backend fed a
  frontend-supplied `repoRoot` straight to the bootstrap (`repo::describe` does
  not re-check `is_checkout()` and never consulted `on_system_drive`), and the
  drive scan returned the **first** drive with a checkout. New
  `repo::validate_target(&Path)` — canonicalize → resolve to a real North Forge
  checkout (`scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` **and** `pyproject.toml`) → reject
  the OS system drive — is now called by **both** `set_repo_root` (the picker) and
  `run_bootstrap` immediately before spawning PowerShell. `resolve_checkout` (and
  a new pure `target_policy` / `is_under_drive_prefix`) auto-picks **only** when
  exactly one checkout exists across every visible drive; otherwise `detect_repo`
  returns `source="ambiguous"` and `location.tsx` shows a "pick the exact one"
  prompt and disables Install (which is also disabled for an on-system-drive
  checkout). `+8` Rust unit tests (`src-tauri` 9 → 17: `cargo test` /
  `cargo build` clean; `tsc` + `eslint` on `location.tsx` clean; `tauri build`
  not re-run — Rust/TS, outside the pytest lane). Paths:

  language** (closes `ERR-2026-09-08-004` / Codex `PC-2026-09-08-005`). Wording
  only — no ledger mechanism built (per the finding's stated scope). `SOUL.md`:
  *"I hold the running picture"* / *"I keep track"* / *"tracking bills and due
  dates"* → *"I write it down"*, *"I work only from what you give me — no bank
  connection, no transaction feed, no ledger of its own"*; affordability answers
  now always state what they leave out (bills not mentioned, irregular costs,
  estimates). `README.md` matched. Paths: `editions/penny-pincher/SOUL.md`,

### Fixed

- **CHG-2026-09-08-009** — **Broaden the `secret-guard` filename blocklist**
  (closes the filename half of `ERR-2026-09-07-007` / Codex F-09). `.githooks/secret-guard`
  `is_forbidden()` went from `.env`-family-only to: `.env` family; OpenSSH private
  keys (`id_rsa` / `id_dsa` / `id_ecdsa` / `id_ed25519`, `.pub` allowed);
  `*.p12` / `*.pfx` / `*.pkcs12` / `*.jks` / `*.keystore`; `credentials.json`,
  `service-account.json`, `*-service-account.json`, `gcloud-service-key*.json`;
  `.netrc` / `_netrc` / `.pgpass` / `.htpasswd`; and PEM / `*.key` / `*.priv` /
  `*.pk8` private keys **except** public CA/cert bundles (`cacert.pem`,
  `*-bundle.pem`, `fullchain.pem`, `chain.pem`, `cert.pem`, …) and **except**
  files under a `test/` / `tests/` / `fixtures/` / `testdata/` / `mocks/` /
  `spec/` / `e2e/` path (throwaway test certs). A `_glob_any` helper does real
  `|`-alternation (POSIX `case` does not expand an alternation from a variable);
  lowercasing is lazy (skips a `tr` fork per path on a full-tree scan); an
  `ALLOWLIST` array at the top of the script is the reviewed, line-by-line escape
  hatch. New `.githooks/tests/secret-guard.sh` (31 cases, green under `sh` **and**
  `dash`). `.github/workflows/nf-secret-scan.yml` now runs both hook self-test
  suites and `secret-guard --tree` / `--range` (filenames) alongside the existing
  `content-scan --commits` (content). `.githooks/README.md` documents the
  blocklist. Verified `secret-guard --tree HEAD` clean on the current tree.

- **CHG-2026-09-08-013** — **`nf_tier` fails closed on a malformed-but-signed
  provisioning record** (closes `ERR-2026-09-08-001` / Codex `PC-2026-09-08-001`).
  `hermes_cli/nf_tier.py::_load_uncached()` did `int(rec.get("schema", 0))` on a
  record whose signature had already verified — a correctly-signed record with
  `"schema": "one"` raised `ValueError` out of `load()`, and
  `hermes_cli/main.py::_nf_tier_gate()`'s broad `except Exception: return None`
  then treated the drive as un-provisioned (a Basic drive would run `-p <other>`
  unblocked). Fix: `_load_uncached()` now validates every signed field's
  type/bounds explicitly (`schema` is an `int` and `== SCHEMA`, `bool` rejected;
  `tier` / `pinned_edition` / `installed_editions` / the text fields typed) and
  every failure — plus a defensive outer `except Exception` — returns
  `Provisioning(STATE_TAMPERED)`. `load()` is now **total** over arbitrary signed
  JSON. `_nf_tier_gate()` additionally fails **closed** (`("block", …)`) on an
  unexpected error whenever a provisioning record file is physically present (new
  import-free `_nf_provisioning_file_present()`); with no record it still returns
  `None` so dev / upstream is byte-identical. `+11` tests in
  `tests/test_nf_tier_enforcement.py` (19 → 30): the exact Codex repro (signed
  record, non-numeric `schema`) as a parametrised unit test **and** an integration
  test (`hermes -p kyocera` exits non-zero, `HERMES_HOME` unmoved), plus a
  fuzz-ish "load is total over arbitrary signed JSON" sweep. Paths:

## [NF-v0.7.0] — 2026-09-08 — hermes@0333d48214 (0 behind upstream/main — rebased onto origin/main)

**`RUN-2026-09-08-003` (reconcile + push):** the block was investigated
uncommitted (contra the earlier "committed to local `main`" claim), then
committed per-CHG, rebased onto `origin/main` (clean, 0 conflicts), and
**pushed** — `origin/main` `0333d48214..b22d5bc33d` (9 commits: the 2 `NF-v0.6.1`
ledger commits + `CHG-2026-09-08-001..007`). content-scan pre-push hook clean. Between the analysis and
the push `origin/main` advanced `85518051ed`-base **+16 → +237** (a large
`Merge branch 'NousResearch:main'` sync landed, tip `0333d48214`); re-checked —
**none** of the 237 origin-only commits touch any file in `CHG-2026-09-08-001..007`
(`config.py`/`config_home.py`/`nf-setup.ps1`/`north-forge.cmd`/`bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`/
`README.md`/`.gitattributes`/`logs/ledger/`/`editions/`/`docs/preview.html`/`nf_tier.py`/
`profiles.py`/`profile_distribution.py`/`apps/bootstrap-installer/`), so the rebase
of the 2 ledger commits + these 7 is conflict-free. `origin/main` contains
`upstream/main` (0 behind). (`git fetch upstream` itself 429'd — rate-limited —
but the coordinate comes from `origin/main`, which carries the NousResearch merge.) **config.py
verification:** `520e63661c` ("…across config and setup") and `c111ede3e5` do
**not** touch `hermes_cli/config.py` or `config_home.py` at all — they're
`config_providers.py` / `model_switch_providers.py` / `models.py` /
`command_token_source.py` (provider-credential resolution for `/v1/models`
discovery). `CHG-2026-09-08-002`'s `_ensure_default_skin()` is a different
subsystem, zero shared symbols; `tests/hermes_cli/test_config.py` = 134 pass. No
silent logic conflict. The separate-pass in-flight edits (`north-forge.cmd`,
`scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`, `tests/test_bootstrap_launcher_hardening.py`)
are **"Codex Audit Batch 1"** — reviewed and landed this pass as
`CHG-2026-09-08-007` (13/13 after `RUN-2026-09-08-003` fixed a test-harness bug:
`& $scriptblockParameter` drops `$LASTEXITCODE` on PS 5.1; the `Invoke-Native`
code was always correct).

**Owner decisions (`RUN-2026-09-08-003`):** (i) commit the whole NF-v0.7.0 tree
per-CHG, rebase the 2 ledger commits + these onto `origin/main`, run the suite,
**push if green**; (ii) Batch 1 goes in as its own commit (`CHG-2026-09-08-007`).
`CHG-2026-09-08-001` (installer GUI) rests on `RUN-2026-09-08-001`'s stated
`cargo test` / `tauri build` verification — not re-run this pass (Rust/TS, outside
pytest). This block's `hermes@` / "behind" coordinates are stamped at the rebase.

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-08-001** — **North Forge Setup GUI (lightweight tier).**
  Retargeted `apps/bootstrap-installer/` (Tauri 2, Rust + React — vendored, 100%
  upstream, never NF-modified before) from the Hermes machine-local installer
  into a branded GUI that runs `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` **unmodified**.
  *Rebrand:* `tauri.conf.json` (productName / identifier / title / publisher /
  copyright), `Cargo.toml` (`[[bin]] name = North-Forge-Setup`, package name /
  description / authors, lib name), `hermes-setup.manifest` →
  `north-forge-setup.manifest` (description + `assemblyIdentity`), icons →
  `assets/icons/north-forge.ico`, all four screen-copy strings, `brand-mark.tsx`
  / `nous-girl.jpg` → an inline North Forge mark, `index.html` title,
  `package.json` (`@north-forge/setup`), `hermes-fade-in` → `nf-fade-in`.
  *Stripped* (dead for a CLI-only, repo-already-on-drive product): the
  `-Manifest` / `-Stage` JSON stage protocol; `update.rs` + `--update` mode;
  `install_script.rs` (the GitHub download / cache / build-pin machinery, and the
  pin-baking in `build.rs`); the Electron desktop-launch path
  (`launch_hermes_desktop`, `resolve_hermes_desktop_exe`, Stage-Desktop); the
  macOS launcher fast-path; `reqwest` / `windows-sys` / `libc` / `futures` and
  three other now-unused crates. *New:* `repo.rs` resolves the checkout
  (env override → installer-relative walk-up → drive scan) and derives the
  sibling `<leaf>-venv` / `<leaf>-data` paths; `run_bootstrap` shells the PS
  script once (`-RepoRoot <root>`, `powershell.rs` streaming kept verbatim) into a
  single indeterminate progress view + the collapsible log panel; `location.tsx`
  is a drive/folder picker that rejects the system drive; the Success screen's
  "Launch" runs `north-forge.cmd` (or `<drive>:\Start North Forge.lnk`).
  *Verified:* `cargo test` 9/9, `tsc` + `eslint` + `vite build` clean,
  `tauri build` → `src-tauri/target/release/North-Forge-Setup.exe` (6.8 MB,
  version resource = "North Forge Setup" / "North Forge" / 0.1.0); the exact
  command the exe issues was run fresh (venv rebuild + editable install →
  "READY") and already-bootstrapped against `D:\north-forge-agent`, and
  `north-forge.cmd --version` reaches a working `hermes`. `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`
  and `nf-preflight.ps1` were **not** touched. Also added `*.rs text eol=lf` to
  `.gitattributes` (matches every other source type; the fork's `.rs` files were
  already LF at HEAD). Toolchain unblocked to build: npm bumped to 11.19.1 in the
  user global (repo `engine-strict` excludes 11.10–11.16), Windows 11 SDK
  10.0.26100 installed (VS BuildTools 2019 had the compiler but no SDK). Paths:
  `apps/bootstrap-installer/**`, `.gitattributes`. Ref:
  `logs/CODEX-INSTALLER-GUI-FEASIBILITY-2026-09-07.md` §3. Run: RUN-2026-09-08-001.

- **CHG-2026-09-08-002** — **North Forge is the enforced first-launch skin.** New
  `hermes_cli/config.py::_ensure_default_skin(home)`, called from
  `hermes_cli/config_home.py::initialize_home()` right after
  `_ensure_default_soul_md` (same seed-time pattern): when the home carries
  `skins/north-forge.yaml` (dropped by `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` /
  `north-forge.cmd`) and `config.yaml`'s `display.skin` is absent or stock
  (`default` / `none` / `null`), it writes `display.skin: north-forge` via the
  fail-closed `atomic_config_write`. An explicit skin — including a later
  `hermes config set display.skin …` — is never overridden; managed homes are
  skipped; the helper never raises. `scripts/nf-setup.ps1` (Setup Run) now also
  sets the same default explicitly as part of provisioning, alongside tier + pin,
  and respects a pre-existing non-stock choice. *Before:* a genuinely fresh /
  re-seeded `HERMES_HOME` fell through `skin_engine.init_skin_from_config` to the
  stock Hermes `"default"` (gold/kawaii) skin. `+7` tests
  (`tests/hermes_cli/test_config.py::TestEnsureDefaultSkin`); verified against a
  fresh home (loads `north-forge`), a non-NF home (untouched), and an explicit
  `crimson` choice (kept). Paths: `hermes_cli/config.py`,

- **CHG-2026-09-08-004** — `docs/preview.html`: a single-file, dependency-free
  tease page — forge palette, inline-SVG compass/anvil/flame mark, a CSS
  recreation of the `skins/north-forge.yaml` session (banner, `❯` prompt,
  `⚒ North Forge` response box, forge spinner, status bar), "what it is" +
  feature grid pulled from `README.md`. Showpiece only, not wired into anything,
  opens by double-click; rendered clean in headless Chromium. Paths:

  Superseded-by: `CHG-2026-09-08-005` (same file rebuilt to embed the real brand
  art in place of the hand-drawn SVG).

- **CHG-2026-09-08-006** — **Edition content + pin-system wiring (three editions).**
  `editions/` gains two new personas and a working install path from repo → live
  profile. *New editions:* `editions/penny-pincher/` (fresh — warm, plain-language
  household-budgeting persona: bills, due dates, "what's left this month?",
  spending-change nudges; explicitly not a power-user finance tool, no investment
  advice) and `editions/pine-barron-farms/` (migrated from
  `D:\KB_PROJECT_2026\PBF_v22_FINAL` — a virtual-production-partner persona:
  accessibility-first working style, the CHANGE BRIEF / WHERE WE ARE / NEXT STEP
  reply structure, a real-public-figure guardrail, a content covenant, and a
  condensed generation method). **The PBF studio canon packet, episode cards and
  personal/family detail were deliberately NOT migrated** — this repo is public;
  `editions/pine-barron-farms/canon/README.md` documents that the real packet is
  dropped in at deploy under `profiles/pine-barron-farms/canon/` (admin-gated,
  Kyocera precedent; `editions/README.md` "no proprietary/personal vertical
  content in the public chassis"). *Mechanism:* each edition is now a **Hermes
  profile distribution** — `distribution.yaml` (name/version/description/
  `hermes_requires`/`env_requires: []`/`distribution_owned`) + `SOUL.md` + `README.md`
  at the folder root, installable with `hermes profile install editions/<name>`.
  `editions/field-service/` got a backfilled `distribution.yaml` so the pattern is
  uniform. `pine-barron-farms/distribution.yaml` lists `canon/README.md`
  (not the `canon/` dir) as owned, so the placeholder ships but a real packet is
  never clobbered by `hermes profile update`. *nf-setup.ps1:* new auto-install
  step — when the `-Pin` (or, on Full, a `-Installed` name) is not a profile yet
  but `editions/<name>/distribution.yaml` is in the checkout, it runs
  `hermes profile install <dir> -y` before writing the signed record; new
  `-SkipEditionInstall` opt-out; `-Installed a,b,c` comma-string (a `powershell
  -File` quirk) is now split; new `Invoke-Hermes` helper (relaxed EAP, exit-code
  judged). `editions/README.md` rewritten to document the distribution mechanism
  and the three editions. *Task 3 (baseline skills):* native image generation
  needs **no build** — the `image_generate` tool is already in the core toolset
  and `plugins/image_gen/` ships `openai` (gpt-image) + `xai` (grok-2-image) +
  deepinfra/fal/krea/openrouter/meta-ai; "enable" = set one provider key
  (`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `XAI_API_KEY`) and optionally pin `image_gen.provider`.
  Also native, key/enable-only: `video_generate` (`plugins/video_gen/` fal/xai/
  deepinfra), `text_to_speech`, `vision_analyze`, free web search
  (`brave_free`/`ddgs`), browser automation. Genuinely missing: music/lyric
  generation (no tool, no plugin). *Verified:* `nf-setup.ps1 -NonInteractive`
  provisioning runs against throwaway data dirs for Basic/`penny-pincher`,
  Basic/`pine-barron-farms`, Basic/`field-service`, and Full/pin
  `pine-barron-farms` + `-Installed` all three — each installs the edition to
  `profiles/<name>/`, writes + signs `provisioning.json`, `hermes profile
  show`/`info` recognise the manifest; `nf_tier.enforce_startup_profile` confirms
  Basic bare-launch → pin, `-p <pin>` → allowed, `-p <other>` → blocked, stale
  `active_profile` → pin, and Full → switchable. PS parse clean. Paths:
  `editions/**`, `scripts/nf-setup.ps1`. Ref: `DECISION-2026-09-07-003`,

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-08-003** — **Docs / versioning consistency sweep.**
  `logs/ledger/README.md` § "North-Forge version" no longer hardcodes a version
  (it read `NF-v0.1.0`; stale — the recurrence the prompt flagged) — it now
  points at the newest `CHANGELOG.md` heading and past-tenses the `NF-v0.2.0`
  milestone. `README.md` § "Drive class" reworded: the volume-name class label is
  a drive-prep convention (no code enforces it anywhere — confirmed), and the
  machine-readable truth (tier + pinned edition) is the on-drive provisioning
  record, read with `scripts\nf-setup.ps1 -Show`. *Verified consistent, left as-is:*
  `pyproject.toml` `0.21.1` (engine version, independent of `NF-v` by design;
  matches `hermes --version`); `CHANGELOG.md` + `INDEX.md` agree on `NF-v0.6.1` /
  `RUN-2026-09-07-011` / `hermes@2237be3559`; `README.es/zh-CN/ur-pk.md` are pure
  landing pages (no version, no install steps, link to canonical README);
  `editions/README.md` + `editions/field-service/README.md` + `.githooks/README.md`
  accurate and cross-consistent; `INDEX.md` open vs resolved incident/decision
  tables correct (nothing resolved still listed open or vice-versa). No README
  claim describes a shipped feature inaccurately or an un-shipped one as done; the
  GUI installer (`CHG-2026-09-08-001`) is deliberately unmentioned in docs until
  it lands on `origin/main`. Paths: `README.md`, `logs/ledger/README.md`. Ref: —.

- **CHG-2026-09-08-005** — `docs/preview.html` rebuilt on the **real brand art**.
  The `CHG-2026-09-08-004` draft drew its own inline-SVG compass/anvil/flame; the
  prompt for the page asked for the shipped assets. Now `assets/banner.png` is the
  hero, `assets/icons/splash-alt.png` sits in the skin-detail block (captioned as
  the held drive loading-screen splash), and `assets/icons/icon-256.png` is the
  favicon + footer mark — each down-scaled and embedded as a `data:` URI (WebP for
  the two line-art panels, PNG for the icon; ~89 KB of base64 total) so it stays
  one file that opens by double-click with **zero** network loads (the only
  external refs are four `href` links to GitHub / the Hermes docs). Also: forge
  palette + named swatches lifted verbatim from `skins/north-forge.yaml`, the CSS
  session recreation updated to `NF-v0.7.0` / `upstream 2237be35` and given the
  `│` tool-prefix line, provenance footer carries both `LICENSE` copyright lines.
  No JS. Verified: headless Chrome render of the full page (hero, what-it-is,

### Fixed

- **CHG-2026-09-08-007** — **Codex Audit Batch 1 — three field-breaking-risk
  fixes to the drive-native launcher / bootstrap** (the batch `RUN-2026-09-07-010`
  queued as "separate commit, hold for review"; `RUN-2026-09-08-003` reviewed and
  landed it). **Fix 1** `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` (+251/−160): under
  PowerShell 5.1, `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` treats a native process that
  merely writes to stderr (uv download progress, pip notices) as a terminating
  error. Every native call now goes through new `Invoke-Native` / `Get-NativeText`
  helpers (EAP relaxed locally, success judged by `$LASTEXITCODE` only), and the
  whole run is wrapped in `Invoke-NfBootstrap` reporting via `$script:__nfExit` +
  `return` so a single outer `finally{}` restores `$ErrorActionPreference`,
  `HERMES_HOME` and `UV_CACHE_DIR` on every exit path. **Fix 2** `north-forge.cmd`
  (+77/−3): renaming the checkout folder derives a new `<leaf>-data` name and
  silently started fresh — the old conversations/config/credentials were not
  found, not migrated, not flagged. The launcher now detects exactly one sibling
  `*-data` folder and makes the operator choose (reuse / start fresh), with no
  timeout and no default; adds `:find_prior_data` / `:consider_prior`. **Fix 3**
  `north-forge.cmd`: `mkdir "%DATA%"` was unchecked — on a read-only / full /
  disconnected drive `HERMES_HOME` pointed at a folder that was never created and
  hermes failed deep in its own startup looking like data loss. Now verified after
  `mkdir` with a clean hard-stop message; the `%DATA%\skins` mkdir gets the same
  guard; the `nf_tier verify` gate is tightened from `if errorlevel 2` (≥2) to
  exact `if "%ERRORLEVEL%"=="2"` so only a real signature failure trips the tamper
  message; hermes's own exit code is now propagated (`exit /b %ERRORLEVEL%`).
  **Tests** `tests/test_bootstrap_launcher_hardening.py` (new, 281 lines, 13
  tests): source-structure assertions + Windows-only tests that drive the real
  `.ps1` / `.cmd`. `RUN-2026-09-08-003` fixed one test-harness bug found on this
  machine: `test_invoke_native_survives_stderr_and_preserves_exit_code` used a
  `Check($name,$block)` helper that invoked a scriptblock **parameter** via
  `& $block` — PowerShell 5.1 does not propagate a native command's
  `$LASTEXITCODE` out of `& $scriptblockParameter` (reproduced with a bare
  `& cmd /c 'exit 3'`, no `Invoke-Native` involved). Rewrote the harness to run
  each probe at script scope; `Invoke-Native` itself was always correct.
  **Verified:** `tests/test_bootstrap_launcher_hardening.py` 13/13; combined
  `test_nf_tier_enforcement.py` + hardening + `test_config.py` = 166 passed.

## [NF-v0.6.1] — 2026-09-07 — hermes@2237be3559 (0 behind upstream/main)

`RUN-2026-09-07-011`. Two owner decisions ratified. **No tracked-file change
outside `logs/ledger/`**; the pass also *executed* the `DECISION-2026-09-06-002`
outcome — deleting `D:\north-forge-agent-attic\nested-clone-2026-09-06\`, an
out-of-tree directory (not a repo change). **PATCH** (ledger-only per the version
table). Not pushed (local-review hold, as with the `NF-v0.4.x` / `NF-v0.5.x`
line). The working tree carried unrelated in-flight edits from a separate pass
(`north-forge.cmd`, `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`,
`tests/test_bootstrap_launcher_hardening.py`) — deliberately **not** staged or
committed here; only `logs/ledger/` is in this commit.

### Ledger

- **CHG-2026-09-07-023** — resolved two long-standing `OPEN` decisions in one
  batch, owner call:
  - **`DECISION-2026-09-06-003` (install model — drive-native run-in-place vs
    machine-local managed install) → DECIDED — A (drive-native run-in-place).**
    Rationale: the sibling-venv layout (venv + `HERMES_HOME` data folder as
    siblings of the checkout on the same drive, nothing on the host), the
    launch-readiness probe (`scripts/nf-preflight.ps1` +
    `scripts/lib/nf-readiness.ps1` — rebuilds the venv **in place** when the
    drive/path moves), and the tier / pin system (`hermes_cli/nf_tier.py` +
    on-drive `provisioning.json` / `.nf-key`, `NF-v0.6.0`) already are a working,
    tested implementation of exactly this model — confirmed independently by two
    Codex audits (`logs/CODEX-AUDIT-2026-09-07.md`,
    `logs/CODEX-HERMES-EDITION-REUSE-CHECK-2026-09-07.md`). Implementing range
    **`NF-v0.5.1` → `NF-v0.6.0`** (load-bearing: `CHG-2026-09-07-015`
    path-safety guard, `CHG-2026-09-07-020` readiness probe, `CHG-2026-09-07-022`
    tier/pin), built on the original minimal bootstrap `CHG-2026-09-07-005`
    (`NF-v0.3.0`). B (machine-local) and C (hybrid) rejected — both leave host
    state / contradict portable-first. The parked **hardened** form (drive seal /
    dual-volume `NORTHFORGE` + `NORTHFORGE-DATA` split / certify-verify-audit) is
    now **unblocked but not mandated** — it was gated only on this ratification;
    starting it is a separate scheduling call. It stays the named home for the
    non-drive-resident key store `DECISION-2026-09-07-003` deferred here.
  - **`DECISION-2026-09-06-002` (attic clone — keep or delete) → DECIDED — A
    (delete), executed.** Same reasoning as at open: `origin/main` carries
    everything, zero unique commits in
    `D:\north-forge-agent-attic\nested-clone-2026-09-06\` (~869 MB), fully
    reconstructible by `git clone`. **Deleted this run** (`RUN-2026-09-07-011`)
    after verifying `820106d4a5` is an ancestor of `origin/main` and the copy had
    no local branches, stashes, or uncommitted work — **~895 MB reclaimed** on
    `D:`. The sibling file
    `D:\north-forge-agent-attic\marguerite-and-penny-suno.txt` was **not** touched.
  - Both blocks moved `## Open` → `## Resolved` in `DECISION-LOG.md` (`Leaning:`
    renamed `Leaning at open:`, a `Decided:` section added, `Blocking:` on -003
    marked cleared); the Register quick-scan rows and `INDEX.md` (open- /
    resolved-decision tables + version and latest-run coordinates) updated to
    match.

## [NF-v0.6.0] — 2026-09-07 — hermes@2237be3559 (0 behind upstream/main)

`RUN-2026-09-07-010`. Written on the `NF-v0.5.5` commit (`13fd25e063`), then
**rebased clean onto `origin/main`** (`a4ffbca513` — the owner's `Merge branch
'NousResearch:main'` upstream sync + a `fmt(js)` pass that landed mid-run); no
file overlap, base moved `hermes@03f3b09222 (47 behind)` → `hermes@2237be3559
(0 behind)`. **MINOR** — a new North
Forge capability: the two-tier (Full / Basic) access model with a pinned
front-door **edition**, enforced at the profile-resolution layer, not just the
UI. This is the tier/pin mechanism the architecture notes flagged as the biggest
blocker; drive naming, the launcher, and the editions concept were waiting on it.
Design recorded in **`DECISION-2026-09-07-003`** (DECIDED). The engine is
unmodified — enforcement rides on Hermes' existing profile system plus one new
North-Forge module and small gates at each profile-selection entry point.

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-07-022** — **Tier / pinned-edition access control.**
  - **An edition is a Hermes profile.** The North Forge generic chassis is the
    root profile (`"default"`); Kyocera / Penny Pincher / Sales / Pine Barron
    Farms are profiles under `<nf-root>/profiles/<edition>/` (installable from
    admin-gated distribution repos via the existing `hermes profile install`).
  - **`hermes_cli/nf_tier.py`** (new, stdlib-only, import-light — it runs before
    argparse). Reads a signed provisioning record written once at Setup Run:
    - `<nf-root>/north-forge/provisioning.json` — `{schema, tier, pinned_edition,
      installed_editions, provisioned_at/by, note, sig}`.
    - `<nf-root>/north-forge/.nf-key` — 32 random bytes, HMAC-SHA256 key, mode
      `0600`, created once, outside `profiles/`.
    - `<nf-root>/north-forge/.nf-admin` — pbkdf2 hash of the admin passcode;
      gates *re-provisioning*, not the signature.
    - States: **unprovisioned** (no record → gate is inert, plain-Hermes
      behaviour — dev checkouts, CI), **active** (signature verifies → tier logic
      applies), **tampered** (record present, signature/key missing or invalid →
      **fail closed:** the drive refuses to start until an admin repairs it).
    - `sig` is HMAC over the canonical signed subset. It is *tamper-evident*
      (stops a casual `"basic"`→`"full"` edit), **not** tamper-proof against an
      operator who scripts a re-sign — the real containment for proprietary
      edition content is that it is never shipped to a Basic drive. Stated plainly
      in `DECISION-2026-09-07-003` and the module docstring (no "credential
      protection" overclaim — cf. `DECISION-2026-09-07-002`).
  - **Enforcement at the dispatch layer** (a UI-hidden option is not access
    control — Codex audit risk):
    - **`hermes_cli/main.py` `_apply_profile_override()`** — new `_nf_tier_gate()`
      runs before the stock `-p` / `active_profile` logic. **Basic tier:** a bare
      launch and a stale `active_profile` both land on the pin; an explicit
      `-p <other-edition>` (or `HERMES_HOME` pointed straight at another profile
      dir) **exits non-zero** with a message naming the pin — never a silent
      redirect, and `HERMES_HOME` never moves. **Full tier:** the pin is the
      default landing profile; `-p` / `active_profile` / the switcher all work.
      **Tampered:** exit non-zero. **Unprovisioned:** returns `None` → stock path
      unchanged.
    - **`hermes_cli/profiles.py`** — backstop `nf_tier.assert_edition_allowed()`
      in **`resolve_profile_env()`** (covers the sudo path, tests, plugins) and
      **`set_active_profile()`** (covers `hermes profile use`, the dashboard
      `POST /api/profiles/active`, `_retarget_active_profile`). `NfTierError`
      subclasses `ValueError`, which every caller here already handles.
    - **`hermes_cli/profile_cmd.py`** — `_nf_guard_mutation()` refuses
      `create` / `delete` / `import` / `install` / `rename` / `alias` on a Basic
      drive (no sideloading editions); `hermes profile list` shows only the pin.
    - **`hermes_cli/web_routers/profiles.py`** — `GET /api/profiles` filtered to
      the pin, `POST /api/profiles/active` and `POST /api/profiles` return **403**
      on a Basic drive.
    - **`/edition`** slash command (new `CommandDef` + `_exec_edition` in
      `slash_exec.py`) — read-only status + switch menu: Full tier lists the
      installed editions and the `hermes profile use <name>` line; Basic tier
      shows the pin and "locked … no switcher". (Switching still needs a relaunch,
      like `hermes profile use`, so the executor stays a pure formatter per the
      registry invariant.)
  - **`scripts/nf-setup.ps1`** (new) — the **Setup Run** wizard (a deliberate
    one-time admin step; **not** run by `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`). Prompts /
    takes `-Tier`, `-Pin`, `-Installed`, the admin passcode; calls
    `python -m hermes_cli.nf_tier` so the sign/verify logic has one
    implementation. PS 5.1-safe: native calls run under a local
    `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'` and are judged by `$LASTEXITCODE`, not
    stderr content.
  - **`scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`** — prints whether the drive is
    provisioned and points at `nf-setup.ps1`; **no tier is set at bootstrap**.
  - **`north-forge.cmd`** — before launch, `python -m hermes_cli.nf_tier verify`;
    a **tampered** record stops the launcher with a plain-language message
    (missing record = normal, exit 0). Independent of the venv-readiness
    preflight.
  - **Tests** — `tests/test_nf_tier_enforcement.py` (19): unit (states, HMAC
    verify, `enforce_startup_profile` matrix, admin passcode, the `__main__`
    CLI); integration through a real `python -c "import hermes_cli.main"`
    subprocess (Basic blocks `-p`/`HERMES_HOME`/stale sticky and forces the pin;
    tampered refuses; Full defaults-then-switches; unprovisioned untouched);
    backstops (`resolve_profile_env`, `set_active_profile`, `profile_cmd`
    mutations, `/edition`); a Windows-only `nf-setup.ps1` end-to-end (provision,
    no-`-Force` refusal, passcode gate). `19 passed`; the NF launcher suites
    (`test_nf_preflight_readiness.py`, `test_bootstrap_north_forge_path_safety.py`)
    still `21 passed`; `tests/hermes_cli/test_commands*.py` + `test_config.py`
    `208 passed`. Pre-existing Windows-lane failures in
    `test_apply_profile_override.py` / `test_profiles.py` are unchanged (verified
    against a clean `main` — `ERR-2026-09-07-002` class, POSIX-only setup). `ruff`
    clean.
  - **Role mapping validated** (per the owner's list): Marguerite → Basic /
    penny-pincher; sales rep → Basic / sales-edition; TSC engineer → Full /
    kyocera default, switcher on; admin → Full / no pin, sees Pine Barron Farms.

## [NF-v0.5.5] — 2026-09-07 — hermes@03f3b09222 (47 behind upstream/main)

`RUN-2026-09-07-009`. Stacks on the (as-yet unpushed) `NF-v0.5.4` commit.
**PATCH** — visual identity: the North Forge CLI skin goes from a text/identity
swap to a full-session re-theme. `skins/north-forge.yaml` only (+ ledger). The
skin **engine is unmodified** — every value stays within the documented skin
contract. **This is version 1 of the rebuild; refinements are logged in
`D:\logs\SKIN-REBUILD-V2_2026-09-07.md` §6.**

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-07-021** — `skins/north-forge.yaml` **rebuilt as a full themed
  session** at the coverage level of the built-in `charizard` skin (motivated by
  `logs/CODEX-SKIN-COMPARISON-2026-09-07.md` — v1 set branding strings + 2 art
  fields and **no `colors:` block**, so every session surface rendered in the
  stock Hermes `default` gold/navy palette).
  - **`colors:` — all 30 keys added** (a "hot-metal gold/amber over dark iron"
    palette). Re-tints the banner Panel, the persistent **status bar**
    (`#1A1410` dark iron, was Hermes navy `#1a1a2e`), the **response-box border**
    (`#FF8C1A` ember, was gold `#FFD700`), the completion menu, the
    `/clarify` / sudo / tool-approval prompts, the voice badge, `shell_dollar`.
    Passes the same WCAG audit the built-ins face
    (`tests/hermes_cli/test_skin_palettes.py`: STRONG ≥ 3.9 / SOFT ≥ 2.8 vs a
    dark pole; `status_bar_*` vs `status_bar_bg`) — `input_rule` lifted
    `#6E4B2A → #7E5734` to clear the SOFT floor.
  - **`spinner:` — full block added**: `⚒/▲/◆/※/✦` faces + 8 forge
    `thinking_verbs` ("heating the stock", "tempering", "quenching", "striking
    while hot"…) + `⟪⚒ … ⚒⟫` wings.
  - **`tool_prefix: "│"`** (was inherited `┊`).
  - **`banner_hero` replaced** — was a chunky block-element anvil; now a
    **Braille-pattern silhouette (U+2800–U+28FF)** of the North Forge mark
    (compass rose + 4-point star + anvil + rising flame), 30×16, matching the
    `HERMES_CADUCEUS` house size, with a bronze→gold→bronze vertical gradient.
    Same static-asset technique as `HERMES_CADUCEUS` / the `charizard` hero —
    generated offline from `assets/icons/icon-512.png` + a redrawn bold compass
    (blueprint line-art from `assets/banner.png` is below Braille's resolution
    floor at this size and was rejected), **not** rendered at runtime.
  - **`banner_logo`** re-tinted to the forge gradient + dot-dash flanking rules
    echoing the reference art (shape unchanged — ANSI Shadow "NORTH FORGE").
  - Verified: `pytest` skin + launcher suites **73 passed**;
    `load_skin("north-forge")` → 30 colours / 8 verbs / `│`;
    `get_prompt_toolkit_style_overrides()` → 39 classes,
    `status-bar => bg:#1A1410`; real `.\north-forge.cmd --version` starts clean.
    Rendered preview (banner + session chrome, before/after) in
    `D:\logs\SKIN-REBUILD-V2_2026-09-07.md`.

## [NF-v0.5.4] — 2026-09-07 — hermes@03f3b09222 (47 behind upstream/main)

`RUN-2026-09-07-008`. Committed on `e288a7f0c5` (`origin/main` tip after
`NF-v0.5.3`). **PATCH** — one critical bug fix to fork launcher tooling
(`ERR-2026-09-07-006`, reclassified CRITICAL after a real first-handoff failure).
No application/engine code; launcher + bootstrap + a new shared probe library +
tests only. `origin/main` advanced +9 mid-run (`e288a7f0c5` `Merge branch
'NousResearch:main'`, an upstream sync); this commit was rebased **clean** onto
it (no file overlap), moving the base `hermes@233757037d (8 behind)` →
`hermes@03f3b09222 (47 behind)`.

### Fixed

- **CHG-2026-09-07-020** — the launcher no longer treats **"`hermes.exe`
  exists"** as proof the run environment is ready (`ERR-2026-09-07-006`, Codex
  audit **F-05**, fix sketch **R-03.3**). A Python venv built on one machine is
  **not portable** to another: copy the drive to a new computer — or just rename
  / re-letter the checkout — and `hermes.exe` + `.nf-bootstrapped` are still
  sitting there while the interpreter fails to start or imports stale code from a
  path that no longer exists. A real first handoff hit exactly this.
  - **New `scripts/lib/nf-readiness.ps1`** (dot-sourced; reports only, never
    acts) — one canonical **four-check launch-time probe**, run before *every*
    launch attempt:
    1. `python_exec` — the venv's `python.exe` actually executes
       (`python.exe -I -c …`, from a temp cwd, hard timeout);
    2. `import_hermes_cli` — `import hermes_cli` succeeds in that interpreter;
    3. `module_in_checkout` — the resolved `hermes_cli.__file__` lives **under
       this checkout**, not a different / old one;
    4. `marker_repo_matches` — `.nf-bootstrapped`'s recorded `repo=` path equals
       this checkout's actual path (canonicalized, `OrdinalIgnoreCase`).
  - **New `scripts/nf-preflight.ps1`** — `north-forge.cmd` runs it before launch.
    If every check passes → exit 0, the agent starts. If **any** check fails →
    **silently rebuild the venv** via `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` (`-Force` when a
    venv is already present; the **data folder is never touched**), then re-probe.
    No error dialog, no admin prompt, no user decision — the same "self-healing"
    principle already used for the drive-letter fixes (`CHG-2026-09-07-012/013`).
  - **Launcher-level log** — `nf-preflight.ps1` appends **one line per launch** to
    `<parent>\<checkout-name>-launcher.log` (a sibling of the checkout, so it
    survives a venv rebuild and lives outside the tree): timestamp, computer
    name, drive + repo path, venv path, every check's `PASS`/`FAIL` (before and
    after any rebuild), the recovery `action`, and the `result`. Written in a
    `finally` via a self-contained `AppendAllText` helper that does **not** depend
    on the readiness library or on Python — a broken interpreter cannot stop the
    line from being written. Single-file rotation at ~1 MB. `north-forge.cmd`
    still writes a crude fallback line itself if `nf-preflight.ps1` is missing.
  - **`bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`** — its "already bootstrapped?" early-return now
    runs the same `Test-NfVenvReady` probe instead of just `Test-Path hermes.exe
    -and Test-Path .nf-bootstrapped`. A present-but-failing venv flips `$Force`
    and falls through to the existing rebuild path (venv only; data untouched).
    The `F-04` path-safety guard (`CHG-2026-09-07-015`) is unchanged and still
    gates the rebuild.
  - **`north-forge.cmd`** — the first-run `if not exist "…\hermes.exe"` gate is
    replaced by the `nf-preflight.ps1` call; the bare existence check survives
    only as the fallback when the preflight script itself is absent.
  - Tests: **`tests/test_nf_preflight_readiness.py`** — 6 portable source-level
    checks (probe names the four checks; `-I` + temp-cwd isolation; preflight
    dot-sources the lib, rebuilds with `-Force`, never `Remove-Item`s venv/data,
    writes the log in a `finally`; `north-forge.cmd` calls preflight before
    launch; bootstrap early-return is probe-gated) + 4 Windows-only behavioural
    checks, including **the actual regression**: a working venv whose *only*
    defect is the marker's `repo=` pointing elsewhere → checks 1–3 `PASS`, check
    4 `FAIL`, `Ready=False`; and a full foreign-machine venv (python base `home`
    gone, marker → other path) driven through `nf-preflight.ps1` → it calls
    bootstrap with `-Force`, writes `action=rebuild-venv` / `result=rebuild-ok`,
    exit 0, and the data folder's canary file survives. `10 passed` +
    `test_bootstrap_north_forge_path_safety.py` still `11 passed`. Verified the
    real launcher end-to-end: `.\north-forge.cmd --version` probes green
    (`action=none result=ready`) and starts the agent; the real
    `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` early-returns on the healthy sibling venv without
    rebuilding.

## [NF-v0.5.3] — 2026-09-07 — hermes@233757037d (8 behind upstream/main)

`RUN-2026-09-07-007`. Committed on `7139d96eb0` (`origin/main` tip after
`NF-v0.5.2`). **PATCH** — one security fix: close the `content-scan` gate bypass
(`ERR-2026-09-07-005` / Codex `F-03`). No application code; hook + hook tests only.

### Security

- **CHG-2026-09-07-019** — `.githooks/content-scan` **whitespace-path bypass fixed**
  (`ERR-2026-09-07-005`, Codex `F-03`). The `--commits` gate (used by the
  `pre-push` hook **and** `nf-secret-scan.yml` CI) built its changed-file list as
  newline text and expanded it **unquoted** — `_scan "$c" $paths`. A legal path
  with a space (`dir/file name.txt`) word-split into non-existent pathspecs and
  its blob was never scanned; a planted `ghp_`-shaped token in such a file passed
  the gate clean.
  - Fix: the gate no longer puts paths in shell variables. New `_scan_commit`
    reads `git diff-tree --no-commit-id -r --no-renames --diff-filter=d -z`
    (NUL-delimited; `-z` also disables git's path quoting) one raw record at a
    time, and `_scan_blob` hands `git grep -P` the **post-image blob object id**.
    No path is passed to git as a pathspec on the gate path, so word-splitting
    cannot occur regardless of spaces / tabs / leading dashes / Unicode.
    `--no-renames` makes every raw record carry exactly one path (a rename ⇒
    delete-old + add-new) and moved content is still re-scanned.
  - `--tree` / `--worktree` (manual-audit modes) are **unchanged** — they only
    ever pass the literal pathspec `.`, which was never affected.
  - `.githooks/secret-guard` (the `.env` *filename* guard) is **not touched** —
    explicitly out of scope.
  - Tests: `.githooks/tests/run.sh` +7 cases — secret in a
    space / tab / leading-dash / non-ASCII filename; a rename into a spaced path
    in one commit; an add-then-delete of a spaced path across the range; and a
    negative control (spaced filename, no secret ⇒ not flagged). **13/13 pass
    under `bash` and `dash`** (CI's `sh`); `sh -n` / `dash -n` clean. A `skip`
    counter was added for the tab/Unicode probes (they ran here; they self-skip
    only on a filesystem that refuses the name).
  - Verified explicitly (same method as the `F-04` fix): planted the exact Codex
    repro — a `ghp_` token in `"my dir/config file.txt"` — and confirmed the
    **pre-fix** script (`git show HEAD~1:.githooks/content-scan`) returns exit 0
    "clean" while the **fixed** script exits 1 and reports the file + line.
  - `.githooks/README.md` reviewed — its description ("scans the content of files
    the new commits changed") stays accurate; no doc change.
  - Paths: `.githooks/content-scan`, `.githooks/tests/run.sh`. Ref:

## [NF-v0.5.2] — 2026-09-07 — hermes@233757037d (8 behind upstream/main)

`RUN-2026-09-07-006`. Committed on `f8e9070942` (`origin/main` tip after
`NF-v0.5.1`). **PATCH** — two cheap doc/CI fixes from the Codex audit
(`logs/CODEX-AUDIT-2026-09-07.md`, `F-08` / `F-10`) plus ledger back-logging of
the audit's five remaining findings. **No behavioural code change.** The audit's
`F-04` (fixed, `NF-v0.5.1`) and `F-06` (addressed, `NF-v0.5.0`) are annotated
resolved inline in the audit file.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-07-016** — `README.md`: removed the stale MinGit prose from the
  stock-Hermes Windows block (Codex **F-08** / R-04.4). Dropped the specific
  "MinGit … unpacked to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\git`" / "~45MB MinGit download" /
  "detects it and uses that instead" detail — upstream's installer now prefers
  PortableGit and uses MinGit only as an arch fallback, so the copied prose was
  already wrong and will keep drifting. Replaced with a one-line pointer to the
  upstream [install guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart),
  keeping only the stable reassurances (no admin, no system-Git changes). Paths:
  `README.md`. Ref: Codex `F-08`. Run: RUN-2026-09-07-006.

### Security

- **CHG-2026-09-07-017** — `.github/workflows/nf-secret-scan.yml`: pinned
  `actions/checkout@v4` → `actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2`
  (Codex **F-10** / R-02.3). `CONTRIBUTING.md` line 891 requires
  `uses: owner/action@<sha>  # vX.Y.Z` for GitHub Actions; every other workflow in
  the repo already uses exactly this SHA + comment. The bare `@v4` tag in the
  newly-added fork workflow was the only violation. Paths:
  `.github/workflows/nf-secret-scan.yml`. Ref: Codex `F-10`. Run: RUN-2026-09-07-006.

### Ledger

- **CHG-2026-09-07-018** — back-logged the Codex audit's five remaining findings
  for future scheduling — **no implementation this run**:
  - `ERR-2026-09-07-004` (HIGH) — `F-02`: `collect-logs.{sh,ps1}` completeness
    check is date-based, not `RUN-`-id-based. Fix sketch R-01.
  - `ERR-2026-09-07-005` (HIGH) — `F-03`: `.githooks/content-scan`
    whitespace-path bypass (reproduced by Codex — a token in `dir/file name.txt`
    passes clean, pre-push **and** CI). Fix sketch R-02. **Marked queued-next.**
  - `ERR-2026-09-07-006` (MEDIUM) — `F-05`: bootstrap readiness marker
    (`.nf-bootstrapped`) never validated against the current checkout → stale-code
    launch. Fix sketch R-03.3.
  - `ERR-2026-09-07-007` (MEDIUM) — `F-09`: secret coverage narrower than
    "credential protection" implies (3 token shapes; `.env`-only filename block).
    Fix sketch R-02.4/5.
  - `DECISION-2026-09-07-002` (MEDIUM) — `F-07`: "engine used unmodified" /
    "full rebrand" wording broader than the code; leaning A (tighten wording, no
    identifier churn).
  - Also: reaffirmed `DECISION-2026-09-07-001` **DECIDED** (splash-art skin swap
    stays — a deferral floated in the `RUN-2026-09-07-005` batch was withdrawn and
    was never executed; corrected the RUN-005 INDEX hedge notes). Removed a stray
    `hermes_cli/CODEX-AUDIT-2026-09-07.md` (misplaced copy in a source dir;
    untracked, not committed — the ignored `logs/CODEX-AUDIT-2026-09-07.md` copy
    is the one that stays).

## [NF-v0.5.1] — 2026-09-07 — hermes@233757037d (6 behind upstream/main)

`RUN-2026-09-07-005`. Committed on `8e4ea037c7` (`origin/main` tip after
`NF-v0.5.0`). **PATCH** — one critical bug fix to fork tooling, landed on its own
commit per owner instruction ("needs to land before anything else touches this
script"). Other queued items (README polish, splash-art deferral, audit
back-logging) are deliberately **not** in this commit.

### Fixed

- **CHG-2026-09-07-015** — `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` — **data-loss
  fix** (Codex audit **F-04**, `ERR-2026-09-07-003`). The path-safety guard
  rejected a venv/data path *strictly inside* the checkout
  (`"$full".StartsWith($RepoRoot + '\')`) but **not one equal to it** — a path
  equal to `$RepoRoot` does not start with `$RepoRoot + '\'`. So
  `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1 -RepoRoot <X> -VenvDir <X> -Force` passed the guard,
  and the later `Remove-Item -LiteralPath $VenvDir -Recurse -Force` would delete
  the checkout. `repo-root-inside-venv` was also unguarded; the gap applied to
  `-DataDir` as well.
  - Fix: two helpers — `Get-CanonicalDir` (`[IO.Path]::GetFullPath`, trim
    trailing `\` `/`, keep a bare `D:\`) and `Test-PathOverlap` (ordinal
    case-insensitive `[string]::Equals`, then `StartsWith(other + '\')` in **both**
    directions). The guard now refuses venv/data **equal to**, **inside**, or
    **containing** the checkout, for `-VenvDir` and `-DataDir` both. The genuine
    default sibling layout (`<leaf>-venv` / `<leaf>-data`) is still accepted.
  - Scope: the default launcher path is **not affected** — `north-forge.cmd`
    passes no `-VenvDir`/`-DataDir`, so the computed siblings are always used and
    always passed the guard. The bug required an explicit dangerous argument;
    no in-repo caller does that. Logged HIGH (audit called it critical).
  - Verified explicitly: constructed the exact F-04 input (fake checkout with a
    canary file, passed as both `-RepoRoot` and `-VenvDir`, `-Force`) → the run
    now exits non-zero at the guard with "Refusing to bootstrap: … is the
    checkout itself, is inside it, or contains it …" and the tree is untouched.
    Also checked the case/trailing-separator/`\.\`-normalized variants and the
    `repo-inside-venv` and `-DataDir`-equals-repo cases.
  - Test: new `tests/test_bootstrap_north_forge_path_safety.py` — 2 portable
    source-level checks + 9 Windows-only script-execution checks (11 total,
    green here). `test_reject_venv_equal_to_repo_root` is the regression that
    matters: it runs the real script on the dangerous input and asserts both a
    non-zero exit and that the canary/`pyproject.toml` survive.
  - Paths: `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`,

## [NF-v0.5.0] — 2026-09-07 — hermes@233757037d (6 behind upstream/main)

`RUN-2026-09-07-004`. Committed on `c4e88d2ab6` (the `origin/main` tip — the
owner's `Merge branch 'NousResearch:main'` that landed mid-run, +15 commits of
upstream `agent/` + `hermes_cli/` model/pricing/codex changes and their tests).
This run's commit was written on the old base then **rebased clean onto that tip**
(zero conflicts; none of the 15 commits touch any file this run changed). Three
drive-native / onboarding changes plus the ledger record of two owner decisions.
**MINOR** — adds new North-Forge capability (a CLI skin, a self-healing drive-root
launcher) on top of upstream; no engine code touched (`hermes_cli/banner.py` etc.
unchanged beyond their existing one-line identity diffs).

Prompted by: the owner followed `README.md` and landed on the upstream `iex/irm`
one-liner (stock Hermes) instead of the drive-native `north-forge.cmd` path.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-07-011** — `README.md` **Quick Install** rewritten so the
  drive-native path is impossible to miss. Before: the section opened with the
  Linux `curl … | bash` one-liner, then a `### Windows (native, PowerShell)`
  subsection whose *only* instruction was `iex (irm …install.ps1)` — the stock
  Hermes installer. `north-forge.cmd` was **not mentioned anywhere in Quick
  Install**. After:
  - A lead paragraph states there are two ways and that running *this fork* means
    the drive-native launcher.
  - First subsection **“Windows — run North Forge from the drive (recommended)”**:
    `git clone` → double-click **`north-forge.cmd`**; explains the sibling
    venv + `HERMES_HOME` on the same drive, nothing on the host, and that you get
    the identity / ledger / CLI skin the stock installer does not set up.
  - A `---` rule + a blunt “Everything below installs **stock Hermes Agent, not
    North Forge**” banner, then the two stock installers under
    **“Stock Hermes — …”** headings; the Windows one is titled
    **“Stock Hermes — Windows (installs stock Hermes, not North Forge)”** with a
    callout blockquote repeating that and pointing back up.
  - No install *command* changed; the one-liners still point at
    `hermes-agent.nousresearch.com` (BRANDING.md category 3). This adds a
    North-Forge-owned path above them and labels the upstream ones — consistent
    with BRANDING.md category 1 (“README … install steps … stay”, but the fork’s
    own run-path is North Forge’s to document).
  - Re `DECISION-2026-09-06-003` (drive-native vs machine-local install, OPEN):
    this documents the **minimal drive-native path that already shipped**
    (`CHG-2026-09-07-005`) as the recommended way to run the fork, matching that
    entry’s standing provisional lean toward A. It does **not** ratify the
    decision or touch the blocked hardened form (seal / dual-volume / certify) —
    and it was an explicit owner instruction this run.
  - Paths: `README.md`. Ref: — (owner report); `DECISION-2026-09-06-003`.
    Run: RUN-2026-09-07-004.

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-07-012** — **North Forge CLI skin** — swaps the stock Hermes
  launch splash (the `⚕` caduceus hero + `HERMES-AGENT` wordmark from
  `hermes_cli/banner.py`) for North Forge’s own mark, **without editing
  `banner.py`**. Implements `DECISION-2026-09-07-001` (owner chose the skin route
  over a `banner.py` edit or “leave as-is”).
  - New tracked file **`skins/north-forge.yaml`** — `name: north-forge`, a full
    North-Forge `branding` block (agent name, welcome, goodbye, response label
    ` ⚒ North Forge `, help header), and `banner_logo` (“NORTH FORGE” in the
    same ANSI-Shadow block style as the built-in god-skins, gold→bronze) +
    `banner_hero` (an anvil-and-sparks motif, 28×11). Colors / spinner /
    `tool_prefix` are inherited from the built-in `default` skin via
    `skin_engine.py` `_build_skin_config` — this is an identity swap, not a
    re-theme.
  - `hermes_cli/skin_engine.py` already loads user skins from
    `HERMES_HOME/skins/*.yaml` and `hermes_cli/banner.py` already prefers
    `skin.banner_logo` / `skin.banner_hero` over its constants — so **zero engine
    files change**. Verified end-to-end against the drive venv:
    `init_skin_from_config({'display':{'skin':'north-forge'}})` →
    `get_active_skin().banner_logo` is the NF art; the `⚕`/`HERMES` constants are
    no longer reachable on that path. Rich parses both art blocks with no
    `MarkupError`; every line is a constant display width (logo 89, hero 28).
  - Activation: `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` copies the skin into
    `HERMES_HOME/skins/` on first bootstrap and runs
    `hermes config set display.skin north-forge` **only if the operator has not
    already chosen a skin** (guarded on the current `display.skin` being unset /
    `default`). `north-forge.cmd` re-copies the file on every launch so a
    `git pull` that updates the art takes effect without a re-bootstrap.
  - Tests: `tests/hermes_cli/test_banner.py`, `test_skin_engine.py`,
    `test_skin_palettes.py`, `tests/test_cli_skin_integration.py`,
    `tests/hermes_cli/test_config.py`, `test_startup_fast_guards.py`,
    `tests/gateway/test_version_command.py`, `tests/agent/test_prompt_builder.py`
    — **all green** (via `uv run --extra dev pytest`; 250 passed / 1 skipped
    across the set).
  - Paths: `skins/north-forge.yaml` (new), `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`,
    `north-forge.cmd`. Ref: `DECISION-2026-09-07-001`. Run: RUN-2026-09-07-004.

- **CHG-2026-09-07-013** — **Self-healing drive-root launcher.** New
  `scripts/make-drive-root-shortcut.ps1` (re)writes **`<drive root>\Start North
  Forge.lnk`** — a double-click launcher that sits beside the checkout folder at
  the root of whatever drive letter Windows currently assigned. Target =
  `<repo>\north-forge.cmd`, `WorkingDirectory` = `<repo>`, `IconLocation` =
  `<repo>\assets\icons\north-forge.ico,0` (falls back to the default icon if the
  `.ico` is absent). `north-forge.cmd` calls it **best-effort on every launch**
  (`>nul 2>&1`, exit code ignored — a failure never blocks the agent starting)
  and `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` calls it once at the end of a fresh bootstrap.
  Because it is rewritten from scratch each run against the path the checkout is
  at *now*, a drive re-letter (`E:` → `F:` …) can never leave a stale pointer —
  the same principle as the `ERR-2026-09-07-001` venv/cache drive-letter fix.
  - Not tracked in git — it is created outside the checkout (at the drive root).
    `.gitignore` gains `/Start North Forge.lnk` as a guard for the edge case
    where the checkout itself is the drive root.
  - Tested (see also `D:\logs\DRIVE-NATIVE-ONBOARDING_2026-09-07.md`): generated
    against `D:\north-forge-agent` → `.lnk` resolves to a real target + real
    icon; **drive-letter change simulated** by pointing `-RepoRoot` at a copy of
    the checkout under a different root — the regenerated `.lnk` correctly
    repoints to the new location; idempotent re-run; `-Quiet` honored;
    `GetPathRoot('D:\north-forge-agent') → 'D:\'` confirms the default link
    location. A real Disk-Management letter reassignment was **not** performed
    (needs admin + is disruptive) — the path-substitution test exercises the same
    code path.

- **CHG-2026-09-07-014** — Ledger: recorded two owner decisions taken this run.
  `DECISION-2026-09-07-001` (splash art) opened **and** resolved DECIDED —
  “swap via a North Forge skin”, implemented by `CHG-2026-09-07-012`.
  `ERR-2026-09-07-002` (upstream Windows `pytest` collection defect) closed
  **ACCEPTED-RISK** — owner’s call: no local `conftest.py` shim, rely on Linux CI
  + targeted Windows runs; revisit if upstream fixes it or a full local Windows
  `pytest` run becomes necessary. No code change for the ERR closure.

## [NF-v0.4.2] — 2026-09-07 — hermes@a7198a8855 (0 behind upstream/main)

Mechanical `upstream/main` sync (`RUN-2026-09-07-003`, step 4 of the consolidated
pass). No rebrand or design content — a rebase only. **PATCH** (upstream sync per
the version table). Pushed with `NF-v0.4.0`/`NF-v0.4.1` this run (force-with-lease;
`origin/main` history rewritten from the old merge-based line to the rebased line).

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-07-010** — `git rebase upstream/main` replayed the 8 North-Forge
  commits (`NF-v0.1.x` ledger → `NF-v0.4.1`) onto `upstream/main` tip
  `a7198a8855`, dropping the two historical `Merge branch 'NousResearch:main'`
  commits (`45b2795865`, `61d30533f7`) as rebase linearizes them. **Clean — zero
  conflicts** across all 8 patches. The gap the last handoff recorded as "13
  behind" had actually grown to **333 behind** (upstream is very active); it is
  now **0 behind**. New HEAD line: `3887dbe70f`..`ef3467348a` on top of
  `a7198a8855`.
  - Verified: `git diff upstream/main HEAD` is exactly the known North-Forge delta
    (ledger, `BRANDING.md`, `.githooks/`, `scripts/`, `editions/`, translated-README
    landing pages, `assets/`, and the small identity touches in
    `agent/prompt_builder.py` / `hermes_cli/{default_soul,banner,_parser,_startup_fast}.py`
    / `cli.py`) and nothing else — no upstream change silently reverted, no NF
    change silently dropped. Upstream did not touch `hermes_cli/default_soul.py`
    in the 333 commits, so `CHG-2026-09-07-009`'s frozen literals rebased without
    contest.
  - Tests (targeted, post-rebase, `uv run --extra dev pytest`): **238 passed / 4
    skipped** across `tests/hermes_cli/test_config.py` (incl. the 2 new
    `test_upgrades_pre_nf_v0_4_0_*` cases and all 6 of `TestEnsureHermesHome`),
    `test_banner.py`, `test_banner_git_state.py`, `test_startup_fast_guards.py`,
    `test_web_profile_soul_writes.py`, `tests/agent/test_prompt_builder.py`,
    `tests/test_install_ps1_ascii_only.py`, `tests/gateway/test_version_command.py`,
    `tests/test_cli_skin_integration.py`. Every surface NF's identity work touches
    is green against the new base.
  - **Finding (not fixed here):** an unfiltered `pytest tests/hermes_cli/` now
    aborts at *collection* on Windows — upstream test files
    (`test_doctor_journal_modes.py` and ~7 others) call `os.geteuid()` as an eager
    `@pytest.mark.skipif(...)` decorator argument, which raises `AttributeError`
    on Windows before the companion `skipif(os.name == "nt")` can take effect.
    These files are **byte-identical to `upstream/main`** — NF touches none of
    them — so this is a pre-existing upstream Windows-only defect surfaced by the
    sync, not a regression from steps 2 or 4. Logged as `ERR-2026-09-07-002`
    (LOW); left for the owner to decide (carry a local test-compat shim vs. wait
    for upstream vs. rely on Linux CI).
  - Paths: none tracked-file (rebase only); ledger. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-07-002`.
    Run: RUN-2026-09-07-003.

## [NF-v0.4.1] — 2026-09-07 — hermes@421c72f3bc (333 behind upstream/main)

> Cut on the old merge-based line, then rebased onto `upstream/main` the same run
> (clean) — see `NF-v0.4.2`. Post-rebase SHA `ef3467348a`, parent `376bd45b43`.


Follow-up to `NF-v0.4.0` (`RUN-2026-09-07-003`). One deliberate loose end from
`CHG-2026-09-07-007` closed by owner review: the seeded-persona auto-upgrade path
now converges homes seeded in the `NF-v0.2.0`..`NF-v0.3.x` window onto the current
North Forge `DEFAULT_SOUL_MD` instead of leaving them stuck on the old
*"You are Hermes Agent, built by Nous Research."* line. **PATCH** — completes an
already-decided rebrand's migration path; no new capability, no behaviour change
beyond the persona text a non-customized SOUL.md converges to. `NF-v0.4.0` is now
on `origin/main` (pushed this run); this block is pushed with it. Upstream has
moved to `a7198a8855` — **333 behind**, not the "13 behind" the last handoff
recorded (upstream is very active; the gap grew ~320 commits since `NF-v0.3.0`
was cut). A mechanical sync attempt is tracked separately this run.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-07-009** — `_LEGACY_TEMPLATE_SOULS` in `hermes_cli/default_soul.py`
  gained the North Forge seeded persona line from `NF-v0.2.0`..`NF-v0.3.x` (the
  text `CHG-2026-09-07-007` rebranded away from), so `is_legacy_template_soul()`
  now recognizes a SOUL.md still carrying that line as non-customized and
  `_ensure_default_soul_md()` upgrades it in place to the current `DEFAULT_SOUL_MD`
  on next run. `CHG-2026-09-07-007` had **deliberately** withheld this — the list
  carries a "never silently overwrite a user's SOUL.md" guarantee and the only
  affected homes were disposable test installs — and flagged it for review; owner
  review this run chose to close the gap now, before real recipient drives are
  built.
  - Two frozen literals added (NOT `DEFAULT_SOUL_MD`-derived, so a later edit to
    the constant can't silently drop the coverage again): the **em-dash** form the
    runtime `_ensure_default_soul_md()` seeds, and the **ASCII `--`** form
    `scripts/install.ps1` writes verbatim (its `$soulContent` here-string, ~line
    3396). The ASCII form was covered by the `DEFAULT_SOUL_MD.replace("—","--")`
    entry until `NF-v0.4.0` repointed that constant at the North Forge text; it is
    now spelled out explicitly.
  - Inserted after the pre-`#95681` upstream text and before the `.replace(...)`
    entry; `_SCAFFOLD_HEAD`/`_SCAFFOLD_TAIL` and list indices 0–2 are untouched
    (they must stay Hermes-verbatim for detection, and `test_config.py` seeds
    `_LEGACY_TEMPLATE_SOULS[0]`).
  - **Not touched:** the persona text `scripts/install.ps1` itself seeds still
    reads *"You are Hermes Agent, built by Nous Research."* (stale against its own
    "MUST match DEFAULT_SOUL_MD" comment) — changing what the installer *seeds* is
    an identity-surface edit of the same class `CHG-2026-09-07-007` deferred
    (`BRANDING.md` category 3), out of this pass's named scope. With this change
    such installs self-heal to the North Forge line on the next `hermes` run.
  - **Tests** — `tests/hermes_cli/test_config.py`: hardcoded `_PRE_NF_V0_4_0_DEFAULT_SOUL`
    fixture + `test_upgrades_pre_nf_v0_4_0_default_soul_md` (mirrors
    `test_upgrades_pre_rewrite_default_soul_md`) and
    `test_upgrades_pre_nf_v0_4_0_ascii_dashed_soul_md`. `TestEnsureHermesHome`
    6/6; 210 passed / 1 skipped across `test_config` + `test_prompt_builder` +
    `test_banner` + `test_startup_fast_guards` + `test_install_ps1_ascii_only`;
    `ruff check` clean on both changed files.

## [NF-v0.4.0] — 2026-09-07 — hermes@61d30533f7 (13 behind upstream/main)

First pass to touch **application code** for identity (`RUN-2026-09-07-002`). The
rebrand had so far been documentation, tooling, and art only (`BRANDING.md` §2
kept the seeded persona and the CLI banner/help text as "intentionally
Hermes-compatible"). `AGENT E`'s first-launch witness run (`FIRST-LAUNCH-WITNESS_2026-09-07`)
confirmed the consequence: a first-time user who bootstraps with `north-forge.cmd`
gets an agent that says *"You are Hermes Agent, built by Nous Research"* and a
`hermes --version` / `--help` banner reading *"Hermes Agent"* — no North Forge
anywhere in the running product. This pass moves those specific surfaces into
North Forge's identity and re-files them in `BRANDING.md`; it also fixes the
cross-volume bootstrap slow path the same witness run measured (`ERR-2026-09-07-001`).
**MINOR** — a North Forge identity surface extended into the runtime; the engine,
repo layout, the `hermes` command name, `HERMES_*` env vars, and the
`hermes-agent` distribution name are all unchanged, and no behaviour changes
except what the agent calls itself. Not pushed pending review (higher-stakes than
a docs pass). HEAD `61d30533f7` is level with `origin/main` but `upstream/main`
has moved **13 commits** since `NF-v0.3.0` was cut this morning — a sync is a
separate task, not folded in here.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-07-007** — Identity surfaces moved from `BRANDING.md` category 2
  (Hermes-compatible, do not touch) to category 1 (North-Forge-owned identity),
  and rebranded:
  - **Seeded / fallback persona identity line.** `hermes_cli/default_soul.py`
    `DEFAULT_SOUL_MD` (seeded into `HERMES_HOME/SOUL.md` on first run) and
    `agent/prompt_builder.py` `DEFAULT_AGENT_IDENTITY` (in-memory fallback when no
    SOUL.md is present, e.g. `skip_context_files` / subagent) — first sentence
    changed from *"You are Hermes Agent, built by Nous Research."* to *"You are
    North Forge, an adaptive AI agent (built on the Hermes Agent engine by Nous
    Research)."* Engine attribution kept (BRANDING.md honesty principle). The rest
    of the behaviour spec (reply-sizing rule, named prohibitions, earned-depth) is
    upstream's and is untouched; the two constants remain **byte-identical** (712
    chars) as `default_soul.py`'s own header comment requires. `_LEGACY_TEMPLATE_SOULS`
    / `_SCAFFOLD_*` in the same file were **not** touched — they must stay
    Hermes-verbatim to keep auto-upgrade detection working. Not added to
    `_LEGACY_TEMPLATE_SOULS`: the outgoing text, so homes seeded between the fork
    start and this commit keep the old persona until edited — deliberate (that
    list carries a "never silently overwrite a user's SOUL.md" guarantee; the
    handful of such homes are all disposable test installs). Flagged for review.
  - **CLI display name.** `hermes_cli/banner.py` `format_banner_version_label()`
    and `hermes_cli/_parser.py` top-level parser `description`: *"Hermes Agent
    v0.21.0 …"* → *"North Forge v0.21.0 …"*, *"Hermes Agent - AI assistant with
    tool-calling capabilities"* → *"North Forge - AI assistant …"*. The version
    number, the `· upstream <sha>` suffix, the `Install directory` / `Install
    method` / `Python` / `OpenAI SDK` lines, and **every `hermes …` example** in
    the help epilogue are unchanged (that is the command name — stays). Two
    degraded-path echoes of the same label updated to match:
    `hermes_cli/_startup_fast.py` (import-failure fallback) and `cli.py`
    (`HERMES_FAST_STARTUP_BANNER=1` fast banner).
  - **`BRANDING.md`** — two new category-1 rows for the above; the old category-2
    row (`DEFAULT_AGENT_IDENTITY`, `DEFAULT_SOUL_MD` — "untouched") replaced with a
    narrower one covering only what still must stay Hermes-verbatim
    (`HERMES_AGENT_HELP_GUIDANCE`, the legacy-SOUL detection strings). The
    command name, env vars, and distribution name rows in category 2 are
    unchanged.
  - **Tests** updated for the new literal: `tests/hermes_cli/test_startup_fast_guards.py`
    (`"Hermes Agent v"` → `"North Forge v"`, 2 assertions),
    `tests/hermes_cli/test_banner.py` (1 assertion).
    `tests/agent/test_prompt_builder.py::test_empty_dir_loads_seeded_global_soul`
    still passes unchanged — the new persona line still contains "Hermes Agent"
    (in the engine-attribution clause).
  - **Deliberately left as "Hermes"** (BRANDING.md category 3 / out of this pass's
    named scope, flagged for a follow-up decision): the `update` / `uninstall` /
    `acp` subcommand help blurbs ("Update Hermes Agent…"), the `/version` REPL
    command description (`hermes_cli/commands.py`), `acp_adapter/commands.py`'s ACP
    version string, and the `⚕ NOUS HERMES` / "AI Agent Framework" startup splash
    art in `cli.py`. `website/**` docs that quote the old fallback text are
    category 3 and stay.

### Fixed

- **CHG-2026-09-07-008** — `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` first-run time on a
  drive-native checkout: **~6.5 min → 5–7 s**. Root cause (`ERR-2026-09-07-001`):
  uv installs by hardlinking packages from its cache into the venv, but uv's
  default cache sits under `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on `C:` while a drive-native checkout
  builds its venv on the checkout's own drive — cross-volume, so uv fell back to a
  full byte copy of all 67 packages ("Failed to hardlink files; falling back to
  full copy"). Fix: before the `uv venv` / `uv pip install` calls, set
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR = Join-Path $parent '.uv-cache'` (a sibling of the venv, so
  always the same volume) unless the operator already set `UV_CACHE_DIR`.
  Measured on `D:\`: install/link step `Installed 67 packages in 740ms` (was
  `6m 25s` on the `E:\` witness run); total bootstrap 7.4 s cold cache / 5.0 s
  warm; the hardlink-failure warning is gone; sibling venv `hermes.exe --version`
  works and shows the new North Forge banner. Paths:
  `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-07-001`,

## [NF-v0.3.0] — 2026-09-07 — hermes@922c0d670c (0 behind upstream/main)

One consolidated pass (`RUN-2026-09-07-001`): a content secret-scanning layer, a
mandatory handoff-redaction gate, a generic-persona + editions-overlay split with
a `BRANDING.md` source of truth, an open install-model decision, a minimal
install-and-launch path, and the final brand art. **MINOR** — new North Forge
capability and workflow on top of upstream; no application code, no `.env`, no
`pyproject.toml` distribution-name change; the engine runs exactly as before
(images, docs, `.githooks/`, `scripts/`, `editions/`, ledger, and the repo-root
`SOUL.md` example file only). While this pass was in flight a GitHub-side "sync
fork" merged `upstream/main` into `origin/main` (`45b2795865`); this block was
**rebased onto it** (clean — disjoint paths), so the fork is now **0 behind
`upstream/main`** at `hermes@922c0d670c`. **Pushed to `origin/main`** — the
review-before-push hold that ran across `NF-v0.1.2`..`NF-v0.2.2` ended here, so
`NF-v0.2.0`..`NF-v0.3.0` are now public together.

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-07-001** — Content secret-scanning layer alongside the filename
  guard. New `.githooks/content-scan` (`git grep -P` based): three high-confidence
  vendor families — AWS access key ids (`AKIA`/`ASIA`+16; the two AWS-doc
  `…EXAMPLE` placeholders excluded), GitHub tokens (`gh[pousr]_`+36,
  `github_pat_`+82; a ≥20-char single-char run excluded), structured Slack tokens
  (`xox[bpars]-<digits>-<digits>-<secret>`, `xapp-1-…`, `xoxe.xox[bp]-…`). Modes:
  `--commits <range>` (per-commit changed-file content — the gate; catches a key
  added in one fork commit even if a later commit renames/deletes the file, and
  does **not** re-flag upstream's own credential-shaped test fixtures),
  `--tree` / `--worktree` (full manual audits). Inline `# nf-scan: allow <reason>`
  marker for confirmed fakes on the exact line — no whole-file/path exclusions.
  Wired into `.githooks/pre-push` (after the existing `secret-guard` calls) and
  mirrored by a new CI workflow `.github/workflows/nf-secret-scan.yml`
  (`content-scan --commits` on every push/PR + the scanner self-tests), so a push
  is checked even where local hooks aren't installed. Tests:
  `.githooks/tests/run.sh` (6 cases, throwaway repos) — a secret added-then-removed
  in a range still fails `--commits`; the final tree alone is clean; an
  allowlisted fixture passes while the same value without the marker is blocked;
  token shapes are caught; placeholders/prose are not. `.githooks/install` and
  `.githooks/README.md` updated. Paths: `.githooks/content-scan`,
  `.githooks/pre-push`, `.githooks/install`, `.githooks/README.md`,
  `.githooks/tests/run.sh`, `.github/workflows/nf-secret-scan.yml`. Ref: — .
  Run: RUN-2026-09-07-001.
- **CHG-2026-09-07-002** — Mandatory handoff redaction before
  `scripts/collect-logs.*` zips the bundle. New `scripts/redact_handoff.py`
  **reuses the agent's production redactor** (`agent.redact.redact_sensitive_text`,
  `force=True`) — no new vocabulary. `collect-logs.ps1` / `.sh` now: resolve a
  Python that can import `agent.redact` (repo `.venv`, a sibling `-venv`, or
  PATH); copy `D:\logs\` to a **throwaway staging dir**; redact the copy (the
  durable session reports in `D:\logs\` are left byte-for-byte intact); write
  `redaction-report.txt` (into the bundle and back into `D:\logs\`) noting what
  was touched with a "pattern-matching is a backstop, not a guarantee" caveat;
  zip the staging copy. **Fail closed:** no importable redactor, or a likely
  secret that still matches a strict AWS/GitHub/Slack recheck after redaction ⇒
  the zip is NOT created, the run exits non-zero, names the `file:line`, and moves
  any previous zip to `<zip>.stale`. `repo-runtime-logs/*.log` / `*.jsonl` are
  **excluded from the bundle by default** (highest-risk, lowest-value); opt-in
  with `-IncludeRuntimeLogs` (ps) / `--include-runtime-logs` (sh) — still
  redacted. Paths: `scripts/redact_handoff.py`, `scripts/collect-logs.ps1`,
  `scripts/collect-logs.sh`. Ref: — . Run: RUN-2026-09-07-001.
- **CHG-2026-09-07-004** — `logs/ledger/decisions/DECISION-LOG.md`: opened
  **`DECISION-2026-09-06-003`** (Install model — drive-native run-in-place vs
  machine-local managed install), status **OPEN**. Provisional lean: drive-native
  (matches the portable-first principle) — **not ratified**. The hardened form
  (sealed drive, `NORTHFORGE` / `NORTHFORGE-DATA` two-volume split,
  certify/verify/audit) is explicitly out of scope and blocks on ratification;
  the minimal bootstrap (`CHG-2026-09-07-005`) is not blocked and ships now. Id
  keeps the `2026-09-06` date at the owner's request for continuity with the
  rebrand batch (opened 2026-09-07). Register row added. Paths:
  `logs/ledger/decisions/DECISION-LOG.md`. Ref: `DECISION-2026-09-06-003`.
  Run: RUN-2026-09-07-001.
- **CHG-2026-09-07-005** — Minimal install-and-launch path (single-drive,
  single-folder-tree; **not** the hardened install — see
  `DECISION-2026-09-06-003`). `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`: creates a
  Python venv as a **sibling** of the checkout (`<parent>\<leaf>-venv`, never
  inside the tree the agent operates on), a sibling data folder
  (`<parent>\<leaf>-data`, reported as `HERMES_HOME`), and an **editable** install
  of the checkout into that venv (`uv pip install -e .`, or
  `python -m pip install -e .`); writes `<venv>\.nf-bootstrapped` as the ready
  marker. `north-forge.cmd` (repo root): double-click launcher — runs the
  bootstrap on first run, then sets `HERMES_HOME` and starts `hermes` with args
  passed through. Tested on a fresh detached checkout: bootstrap → `hermes`
  importable + `hermes.exe` present in ~7 s (uv cache); `hermes --version` /
  `--help` work. No `NORTHFORGE`/`NORTHFORGE-DATA` split, no seal/verify. Paths:
  `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`, `north-forge.cmd`. Ref:
  `DECISION-2026-09-06-003`. Run: RUN-2026-09-07-001.
- **CHG-2026-09-07-006** — Final (non-placeholder) brand art from
  `north-forge-brand-assets.zip` (confirmed to contain exactly `banner.png`,
  `north-forge.ico`, `icon-512.png`, `icon-256.png`, `splash-alt.png`).
  `assets/banner.png` replaced with the final banner (1510×724 PNG, compass +
  anvil + flame, "NORTH FORGE"); this **retires the `CHG-2026-09-06-025`
  placeholder** — the new file carries no `PLACEHOLDER` `tEXt` chunk. `README.md`
  needed no edit — it had no placeholder note or "temporary artwork" callout
  (that note lived only in the old PNG's metadata). Added `assets/icons/` —
  `north-forge.ico` (Windows multi-resolution), `icon-512.png`, `icon-256.png`,
  and `splash-alt.png` (held in reserve for a future loading screen; not wired).
  **Icon wiring:** North Forge's own launcher (`north-forge.cmd`) and bootstrap
  create no Start-Menu/desktop shortcut, and upstream `scripts/install.ps1`'s
  shortcut step is application code and out of scope — so the `.ico` is staged
  and `BRANDING.md` records that a future shortcut should point at
  `assets/icons/north-forge.ico`; **shortcut-icon wiring is pending real shortcut
  creation.** Images + one doc-of-record only; agent behaviour unaffected. Paths:
  `assets/banner.png`, `assets/icons/north-forge.ico`, `assets/icons/icon-512.png`,
  `assets/icons/icon-256.png`, `assets/icons/splash-alt.png`. Ref: — .
  Run: RUN-2026-09-07-001.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-07-003** — Generic root persona + editions overlay + branding
  source of truth. `SOUL.md` (repo root) is now the **industry-neutral** chassis
  voice (the general-purpose draft: adaptive tone, honest about uncertainty,
  direct — no field technicians / sales reps / industry). The
  field-service-flavoured persona moved to `editions/field-service/SOUL.md` with
  `editions/field-service/README.md` explaining it is an **optional profile
  overlay, applied on top of the base persona at deploy time, never a
  replacement**; `editions/README.md` describes the `editions/` concept (additive,
  optional, non-proprietary — vertical skill-sets stay in admin-gated repos).
  New **`BRANDING.md`** — the source of truth for which surfaces are
  North-Forge-owned, which are intentionally Hermes-compatible (the `hermes-agent`
  distribution name, the `hermes` commands, workspace package names, persona code
  constants, `HERMES_*` env vars), and which are upstream documentation left
  pointing at Nous. The three translated READMEs (`README.es.md`,
  `README.zh-CN.md`, `README.ur-pk.md`) reduced from full (stale, still
  Hermes-branded) translations to **short landing pages** — North Forge banner, a
  2–3 sentence description in the target language, and links to the canonical
  English `README.md` and upstream's docs (incl. the `zh-Hans` docs for Chinese).
  Repo-root `SOUL.md` is a seed/example file read by no test / installer /
  packaging path (installers seed from `hermes_cli/default_soul.py`, untouched),
  so this has **zero functional effect**. Paths: `SOUL.md`,
  `editions/field-service/SOUL.md`, `editions/field-service/README.md`,
  `editions/README.md`, `BRANDING.md`, `README.es.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`,
  `README.ur-pk.md`. Ref: `DECISION-2026-09-06-001` (branding continuation).
  Run: RUN-2026-09-07-001.

### Unchanged (called out)

- **Application code, `.env`, `pyproject.toml` distribution name, the attic
  clone, `agent/prompt_builder.py` / `hermes_cli/default_soul.py` persona
  constants** — untouched. Same carve-outs as `NF-v0.2.0` (`DECISION-2026-09-06-001`).
- **`docker/SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING*.md`, `SECURITY*.md`,
  `website/**`** — upstream documentation, left as-is (see `BRANDING.md` §3).
- **`assets/icons/splash-alt.png`** — added but deliberately not wired into
  anything (future loading-screen use).
- **The hardened install** (sealed drive / two-volume split / certification) —
  not built; blocked on `DECISION-2026-09-06-003`.

### Housekeeping

- `D:\logs\GIT_HARDENING_2026-09-06.md` line 173 — an in-place redaction run
  (before `CHG-2026-09-07-002` switched to a staging copy) had mangled
  `secret-guard: clean` → `secret-guard: ***` (a config-key false positive on the
  `secret-guard:` label). Restored by hand; the staging-copy design prevents
  recurrence. `D:\logs\` is outside the repo — no tracked-file change.

## [NF-v0.2.2] — 2026-09-06 — hermes@693641aa8b (0 behind upstream/main)

Handoff tooling + a standing agent-conduct policy. **PATCH** per the version
table ("housekeeping" + "docs / ledger-only"). No application code, no `.env`,
no packaging change; agent runtime behaviour untouched. All entries in this
block are `RUN-2026-09-06-003`. **Committed locally; not pushed** — held for
review, same as everything since `NF-v0.1.1`.

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-06-027** — `scripts/collect-logs.ps1` + `scripts/collect-logs.cmd`
  (double-click wrapper) + `scripts/collect-logs.sh` (POSIX mirror): a
  one-command builder for the review/handoff bundle. It (a) copies
  `logs/ledger/**` into `D:\logs\ledger\`, (b) writes a git snapshot to
  `D:\logs\repo-state.txt` (HEAD, branch, ahead/behind `origin` + `upstream`,
  uncommitted files, recent log), (c) generates `D:\logs\HANDOFF-INDEX.md`
  (manifest + check results), (d) copies any `logs/*.log` / `*.jsonl` if present,
  (e) removes superseded `north-forge-agent-logs-*.zip` nested bundles, (f) zips
  `D:\logs\` → `D:\logs.zip` (overwrite) + writes `D:\logs.zip.sha256`, and
  (g) runs a completeness self-check (ledger copied in full; key ledger files
  present + non-empty; audits/templates counts; local not behind `origin/main`;
  uncommitted-tree warning; **session-report-vs-ledger date freshness**; zip
  entry-set matches staging; zip newer than inputs). Exit 0 unless a check
  FAILs. Existing `D:\logs\*.md` session reports are never touched. Paths
  outside the repo (`D:\logs\`, `D:\logs.zip`) are **not** tracked — only the
  three scripts are. Runnable by hand any time and as end-of-task practice; no
  dependency on being invoked by an agent. Paths: `scripts/collect-logs.ps1`,
  `scripts/collect-logs.cmd`, `scripts/collect-logs.sh`. Ref: — . Run:
  RUN-2026-09-06-003.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-06-028** — `logs/ledger/README.md`: new **"## Agent conduct"**
  section (between "Workflow — the discipline" and "Optional automation").
  States the standing policy: incidental **minor** bugs found during any task
  are fixed and logged in the same run without stopping for approval; anything
  touching **architecture, access-tier logic, secrets, or an already-flagged
  `OPEN` `DECISION-`/`ERR-`** still escalates on the existing path; when unsure
  whether something is "minor", escalate rather than guess. Also records the
  end-of-task handoff step (run `scripts/collect-logs.*`, drop a
  `D:\logs\<TOPIC>_<date>.md` write-up). Paths: `logs/ledger/README.md`.
  Ref: — . Run: RUN-2026-09-06-003.

### Unchanged (called out)

- **`D:\logs\` and `D:\logs.zip`** — regenerated artifacts, outside the repo,
  not committed (same as before). Prior hand-built `D:\logs\*.md` session
  reports are kept as-is by the script.
- **Application code, `.env`, packaging** — untouched.

## [NF-v0.2.1] — 2026-09-06 — hermes@693641aa8b (0 behind upstream/main)

Finishes the branding pass started by **`DECISION-2026-09-06-001` Option B (full
rebrand)** — the two items the `NF-v0.2.0` commit left open. **PATCH** per the
version table ("docs" + one image asset; no new capability, no further reshape).
Branding / docs only — no application code, no `.env`, no `pyproject.toml`
distribution-name change, no attic-clone change; agent behaviour is identical
before and after. All entries in this block are `RUN-2026-09-06-003`.
**Committed locally; not pushed** — held for review, same as `NF-v0.1.2` /
`NF-v0.2.0`.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-06-025** — `assets/banner.png`: replaced the upstream Hermes Agent
  banner (blocky gold "HERMES-AGENT" wordmark) with a North Forge equivalent —
  same envelope (1145×196, PNG, 8-bit RGB, non-interlaced): "NORTH FORGE"
  wordmark, an anvil mark, an amber accent rule, and the strap-line "A brandable
  AI-agent chassis on the Hermes engine" on a dark ground. **This is a
  PLACEHOLDER, not final brand art** — an auto-generated wordmark (Pillow +
  system fonts); a `PLACEHOLDER - replace with final art` note is carried in the
  PNG `tEXt` chunks (`Title` / `Comment`). Restored the banner reference in
  `README.md` (removed by `CHG-2026-09-06-020`): a centred
  `<img src="assets/banner.png" alt="North Forge" width="100%">` directly under
  the `# North Forge` H1. The three translated READMEs
  (`README.es.md` / `README.zh-CN.md` / `README.ur-pk.md`) already reference the
  same path with `alt="Hermes Agent"` — left as-is here (out of scope; see the
  known-issues note below). Paths: `assets/banner.png`, `README.md`. Ref:
  `DECISION-2026-09-06-001`. Run: RUN-2026-09-06-003.

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-06-026** — `README.md`: two new top-level sections between
  "Getting Started" and the Nous Portal section. **"Drive class"** (one sentence)
  — acknowledges that a deployed drive carries a class label in its volume name
  so a recipient or support person can identify the drive at a glance;
  deliberately documents *no* naming scheme, codes, or access mechanics.
  **"Customizing your agent"** (two short paragraphs) — plain-language statement
  that some North Forge editions allow full customization of the underlying AI
  (model/provider, persona, configuration) via the drive's setup menu while
  others ship pre-configured; describes only the user-facing difference, no
  passcode / admin / unlock mechanism. Paths: `README.md`. Ref:
  `DECISION-2026-09-06-001`. Run: RUN-2026-09-06-003.

### Unchanged (called out)

- **Application code, `.env`, `pyproject.toml` distribution name, the attic
  clone, the translated `README.*.md` files** — untouched, same carve-outs as
  `NF-v0.2.0`.

### Known / carried forward

- The translated READMEs (`README.es.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `README.ur-pk.md`)
  now render the new North Forge banner but still carry `alt="Hermes Agent"`.
  Pre-existing (they were left upstream-branded at the rebrand); a follow-up if
  those files are kept rather than dropped.
- `ERR-2026-09-06-001` (**OPEN**, HIGH) — live `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; unchanged,
  user-owned.
- `DECISION-2026-09-06-002` (**OPEN**) — attic-clone keep-or-delete; unchanged.

## [NF-v0.2.0] — 2026-09-06 — hermes@693641aa8b (0 behind upstream/main)

First fork-identity commit — **`DECISION-2026-09-06-001` Option B (full rebrand)**,
implemented. **MAJOR** bump per the version table ("incompatible change to the
fork's shape — rebrand"): the repo now presents as **North Forge**, a generic,
brandable agent chassis on the Hermes Agent engine, not as Hermes Agent itself.
Branding / identity only — no application code, no `.env`, no attic-clone change.
Agent behaviour is identical before and after: the repo-root `SOUL.md` is an
example file read by no test / installer / packaging path, and the persona code
constants (`agent/prompt_builder.py`, `hermes_cli/default_soul.py`) were not
touched. All entries in this block are `RUN-2026-09-06-002`. **Committed locally;
not pushed** — held for review before going public, same as the last hardening
commit.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-06-020** — `README.md`: rewrote the top-level identity. H1
  (`Hermes Agent ☤` → `North Forge`), centre tagline, shields, and the lead
  description now present North Forge as its own project built on the Hermes
  Agent engine by Nous Research; added a one-paragraph provenance note (fork of
  `NousResearch/hermes-agent`, kept rebased, engine used unmodified, maintainer
  Kenneth C. Walker Jr., fork-issue URL) and both copyright lines in the License
  footer. The upstream banner image (`assets/banner.png`, alt "Hermes Agent") is
  no longer referenced. All mechanics — install one-liners, `hermes …` commands,
  `hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs` links, feature table, Contributing,
  Community — left verbatim. Paths: `README.md`. Ref: `DECISION-2026-09-06-001`.
  Run: RUN-2026-09-06-002.
- **CHG-2026-09-06-021** — `SOUL.md`: replaced the upstream default persona with
  North Forge's own voice (finalised 2026-09-06 from owner-supplied text, before
  any push; the intermediate draft in this commit's first local revision was
  never published). First person ("I'm North Forge"), written for field
  technicians and sales reps: plain words, short sentences, no corporate filler,
  no fake enthusiasm, no "I apologize for the confusion" — own a mistake and fix
  it. Matches the user's register (terse ↔ chatty ↔ formal) rather than imposing
  one fixed personality; honest about what it does not know ("here's what I know,
  here's what I'm not sure of, here's what would confirm it"); does not talk down
  and does not assume unseen expertise; direct out of respect for the reader's
  time, flags risk and faster paths up front. No Kyocera / Blacksmith / mode
  scaffolding — this is the industry-generic chassis file. Repo-root example file
  only — not read by any test, installer, or packaging path (installers seed
  `$HERMES_HOME/SOUL.md` from `hermes_cli/default_soul.py`, untouched), so it
  diverges from the `DEFAULT_SOUL_MD` / `DEFAULT_AGENT_IDENTITY` code constants by
  design, with zero functional effect. Paths: `SOUL.md`. Ref:
  `DECISION-2026-09-06-001`. Run: RUN-2026-09-06-002.
- **CHG-2026-09-06-022** — `package.json`: `name` `hermes-agent` →
  `north-forge-agent`; `repository.url`, `homepage`, and `bugs.url` repointed
  from `NousResearch/Hermes-Agent` to `kwalker7631/north-forge-agent`. Root
  `name` in `package-lock.json` synced to match (2 lines: `.name` and
  `.packages[""].name`) — identity mirror only, no dependency-tree change, so
  `npm ci` stays consistent with the manifest. Root package is `"private": true`
  and never published; workspace package names (`hermes-tui`, `hermes`,
  `@hermes/root-tests`) left as-is — internal build ids, same blast-radius
  rationale as the pyproject distribution name. Paths: `package.json`,
  `package-lock.json`. Ref: `DECISION-2026-09-06-001`. Run: RUN-2026-09-06-002.
- **CHG-2026-09-06-023** — `pyproject.toml`: added `[project.urls]` (`Homepage` +
  `Repository` → `kwalker7631/north-forge-agent`). The Python **distribution name
  deliberately stays `hermes-agent`** per `DECISION-2026-09-06-001`: never
  published (`setup.py` blocks wheel builds), referenced ~19× by the
  self-referential `hermes-agent[...]` extras, and pinned in `uv.lock` / the
  installed `.venv` — renaming it is blast radius with no outward benefit.
  `authors = [{ name = "Nous Research" }]` also left as-is (engine authorship;
  outside the decision's enumerated fields — attribution is carried by
  `LICENSE`). Paths: `pyproject.toml`. Ref: `DECISION-2026-09-06-001`. Run:
  RUN-2026-09-06-002.

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-06-024** — `LICENSE`: added `Copyright (c) 2026 Kenneth C. Walker
  Jr.` beneath the existing `Copyright (c) 2025 Nous Research` line. MIT — both
  attributions coexist; Nous Research's line and the permission / warranty body
  are unchanged. Paths: `LICENSE`. Ref: `DECISION-2026-09-06-001`. Run:
  RUN-2026-09-06-002.

### Unchanged (called out)

- **`pyproject.toml` `name = "hermes-agent"`** — NOT renamed (see
  CHG-2026-09-06-023). This is the explicit carve-out in `DECISION-2026-09-06-001`
  Option B.
- **Application code, `.env`, the attic clone, `docker/SOUL.md`, the translated
  `README.zh-CN.md` / `README.es.md` / `README.ur-pk.md` files, workspace
  `package.json` names** — untouched.
- **`agent/prompt_builder.py` / `hermes_cli/default_soul.py`** — the persona code
  constants are upstream's and stay upstream's; only the repo-root `SOUL.md`
  example file carries the North Forge voice.

## [NF-v0.1.2] — 2026-09-06 — hermes@693641aa8b (0 behind upstream/main)

`ledger-schema v1 → v2`. Ledger-tooling only — no application code, no `.env`, no
attic-clone change. All entries in this block are `RUN-2026-09-06-001`. `NF-v0.2.0`
stays reserved for the first fork-identity commit. **Committed locally; not pushed —
handoff is the `logs/` zip.**

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-06-015** — New **decision register**: `decisions/DECISION-LOG.md`
  (Open / Resolved / Register, same shape as `errors/ERROR-LOG.md`) and
  `templates/DECISION-ENTRY-TEMPLATE.md`. `DECISION-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` ids, same
  immutability / supersession / cross-link rules as `ERR-`. Seeded with
  `DECISION-2026-09-06-001` (fork identity — migrated from the identity half of
  `ERR-2026-09-06-002`, links both ways) and `DECISION-2026-09-06-002` (attic-clone
  keep-or-delete — newly opened; never had an `ERR-` id). Paths:
  `logs/ledger/decisions/DECISION-LOG.md`, `logs/ledger/templates/DECISION-ENTRY-TEMPLATE.md`.
  Ref: — . Run: RUN-2026-09-06-001.
- **CHG-2026-09-06-016** — `AUDIT-TEMPLATE.md`: mandatory **section 1 "Since last
  handoff"** (Closed / New / Unchanged vs the previous audit's open items), written
  before the rest of the body; remaining sections renumbered 2–7. Paths:
  `logs/ledger/templates/AUDIT-TEMPLATE.md`. Ref: — . Run: RUN-2026-09-06-001.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-06-017** — **Confidence tags** on findings and register entries:
  fixed vocabulary `Confirmed Fact` / `Field-Reasoned` / `Unverified`, defined in
  `README.md`, required on every `AUDIT-` finding, `ERR-` entry, and `DECISION-`
  entry. Added the field to `AUDIT-TEMPLATE.md`, `ERROR-ENTRY-TEMPLATE.md`, and
  `DECISION-ENTRY-TEMPLATE.md`. Paths: `logs/ledger/README.md`,
  `logs/ledger/templates/*`. Ref: — . Run: RUN-2026-09-06-001.
- **CHG-2026-09-06-018** — **Run IDs**: `RUN-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN`, one per agent
  invocation, assigned at session start; `Run:` field on every `CHG-` / `ERR-` /
  `DECISION-` entry and in the audit header. Traceability only — groups entries by
  session, does not replace their ids. Defined in `README.md`; field added to
  `CHANGE-ENTRY-TEMPLATE.md`, `ERROR-ENTRY-TEMPLATE.md`, `DECISION-ENTRY-TEMPLATE.md`,
  `AUDIT-TEMPLATE.md`. This session = `RUN-2026-09-06-001`. Paths:
  `logs/ledger/README.md`, `logs/ledger/templates/*`. Ref: — . Run: RUN-2026-09-06-001.
- **CHG-2026-09-06-019** — `README.md` + `INDEX.md` rolled to `ledger-schema v2`:
  directory diagram (+`decisions/`), naming table (+`DECISION-`, +`RUN-`), an
  `ERR-` vs `DECISION-` boundary table, new `Confidence tags` and `Run IDs`
  sections, workflow steps updated. `INDEX.md` split into **Open incidents
  (faults)** and **Open decisions (judgment calls)**; `ERR-2026-09-06-002` moved to
  Resolved (fault half fixed by `CHG-2026-09-06-014`, choice half → `DECISION-2026-09-06-001`).
  Paths: `logs/ledger/README.md`, `logs/ledger/INDEX.md`,
  `logs/ledger/errors/ERROR-LOG.md`. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-06-002`. Run: RUN-2026-09-06-001.

### Unchanged (called out)

- No `CHG-` bullet content was rewritten; `ERR-2026-09-06-001/003/004/005` blocks are
  untouched except a one-line legacy note in the `ERROR-LOG.md` preamble and a retro
  `Run:`/`Confidence` note on `ERR-2026-09-06-005`. No IDs reused or deleted.

---

## [NF-v0.1.1] — 2026-09-06 — hermes@693641aa8b (0 behind upstream/main)

Landed the `NF-v0.1.0` hardening set (it had been working-tree-only), cleared
Windows/pytest cruft that had re-accumulated in `north-forge-agent`, and **synced
the fork to `upstream/main`** — the ledger commit was rebased onto `693641aa8b`, so
the fork is no longer behind upstream. First commits on the fork; pushed to
`origin/main`. Fork *identity* (rebrand vs thin-downstream) is still deferred — the
"sync only" path was chosen. No application code changed by north-forge. See
`audits/AUDIT-2026-09-06-002-hardening-commit-and-hygiene.md`.

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-06-010** — Committed the `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001` remediation set to
  local `main`: the `.gitignore` secrets/ledger/junk hunk, `.githooks/`
  (`secret-guard` + `pre-commit` + `pre-push`), and the whole `logs/ledger/` tree
  (`ledger-schema v1`, `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001`, templates). It was all uncommitted —
  a fresh clone had neither the secret guard nor the ledger. Not pushed (see
  `ERR-2026-09-06-002`). `pre-commit` `secret-guard` passed. Paths: `.gitignore`,
  `.githooks/`, `logs/ledger/`. Ref: `AUDIT-2026-09-06-002` F-01.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-06-011** — `.gitignore`: added guards for working-tree artifacts
  that recur on this Windows checkout — `MagicMock/` (unittest.mock path leak);
  `*hermes-pytest-tmp*`, `*pytest-tmproot*`, `*pytest-of-*` (pytest tmp-path files
  written into cwd as literal `C:Users…` names — matched on the ASCII substring
  since the `:` survives as a name char under Git-Bash); `/logs.zip` (a zipped copy
  of `logs/`); and `/marguerite-and-penny-suno.txt` (an unrelated stray that a
  plain move failed to hold twice — canonical copy stays in
  `D:\north-forge-agent-attic\`). Paths: `.gitignore`. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-06-005`,
  `AUDIT-2026-09-06-002` F-02/F-03/F-04.

### Fixed

- **CHG-2026-09-06-012** — Removed recurred / stray junk from the `north-forge-agent`
  working tree: the `%SystemDrive%/ProgramData/…` cache tree (recurred after
  `CHG-2026-09-06-009`, exactly as `ERR-2026-09-06-004` foresaw; still git-ignored,
  so harmless), `MagicMock/`, four `C:Users…hermes-pytest-tmp…` pytest files,
  `logs.zip`, and the re-strayed `marguerite-and-penny-suno.txt`. Also cleared
  three stale `logs/full_suite_run*.log` runtime logs (~6.6 MB, git-ignored —
  housekeeping only). No tracked file deleted. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-06-004`
  (recurrence), `ERR-2026-09-06-005`.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-06-014** — Synced the fork to `NousResearch/hermes-agent`
  `upstream/main`. `git rebase upstream/main` replayed the `CHG-2026-09-06-010`
  ledger commit (no conflicts — the 2 upstream commits `be58c276ee` /
  `693641aa8b` touch only `agent/`, `evals/`, `gateway/`, `tests/`, `website/`,
  disjoint from `.gitignore` / `.githooks/` / `logs/ledger/`). `main`:
  `820106d4a5 + [ledger]` → `693641aa8b + [ledger]`. Pushed to `origin/main` as a
  fast-forward (`ahead 3`: the 2 upstream commits + the ledger commit). Closes the
  version-drift half of `ERR-2026-09-06-002`; the fork-identity half stays OPEN
  (deferred by choice). Ref: `ERR-2026-09-06-002`.

### Housekeeping (no tracked-file change)

- **CHG-2026-09-06-013** — `git gc` on the three live repos on `D:\`
  (`north-forge-agent`, `hermes-webui`, `north-forge-hermes-edition`) to repack
  loose objects. The attic clone `nested-clone-2026-09-06` was left as-is (it is a
  delete-when-confirmed backup, not a working repo). Reclaimed sizes: see the
  `D:\logs` report.
- Git freshness verified: all three local branches are level with their `origin`
  (`north-forge-agent` `main`==`820106d4a5`, `hermes-webui` `master`==`e168b67e`,
  `north-forge-hermes-edition` `main`==`1c47b60`); `git pull --ff-only` on each was
  a no-op. `north-forge-agent` is still 2 behind `upstream/main` — `ERR-2026-09-06-002`.

### Known / carried forward

- `ERR-2026-09-06-001` (**OPEN**, HIGH) — live `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; now also noted
  at `D:\.env` (drive root, outside any repo). In-repo exposure structurally
  mitigated **and now committed**. Still pending the user's confirm-or-rotate.
- `ERR-2026-09-06-002` — version-drift half **closed** by `CHG-2026-09-06-014`
  (synced to `upstream/main` `693641aa8b`, `NF-v0.1.0`/`v0.1.1` pushed to `origin`).
  Identity half (rebrand vs thin-downstream, first identity commit, `NF-v0.2.0`) was
  deferred here. *→ Superseded 2026-09-06 (`NF-v0.1.2`, `CHG-2026-09-06-019`): the*
  *identity choice migrated to `DECISION-2026-09-06-001`; this `ERR-` is now RESOLVED.*
- `ERR-2026-09-06-005` (**RESOLVED**) — pytest/mock working-tree artifacts. Fixed
  by `CHG-2026-09-06-011` / `CHG-2026-09-06-012`.

## [NF-v0.1.0] — 2026-09-06 — hermes@820106d4a5 (2 behind upstream/main)

> **Committed 2026-09-06** on local `main` (`CHG-2026-09-06-010`, `NF-v0.1.1` block
> above); previously working-tree-only. Not pushed.

First ledger entry. Baseline repository cleanup and establishment of the project
ledger. No application code changed. All items below are in the **working tree,
uncommitted** — see the audit's "Open items" for the commit decision.

### Changed

- **CHG-2026-09-06-001** — Fast-forwarded local `main` `245e48008f` → `820106d4a5`
  (245 commits) to match `origin/main`. The local checkout was ~1 day stale. Clean
  fast-forward, no local commits existed. Motivated by `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001` F-03.
- **CHG-2026-09-06-004** — `.gitignore`: carved `logs/ledger/` out of the upstream
  `logs/` ignore rule (`logs/` → `logs/*` + `!logs/ledger/`) so this ledger is
  version-controlled while Hermes runtime logs in `logs/` stay ignored. Motivated by
  `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001` F-04.
- **CHG-2026-09-06-005** — `.gitignore`: added `/north-forge-agent/` guard so a repo
  cloned inside this checkout again cannot be swept into a commit. Motivated by
  `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001` F-01 / F-04.

### Added

- **CHG-2026-09-06-006** — Established `logs/ledger/` (`ledger-schema v1`):
  `README.md` (rules), `INDEX.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `audits/`, `errors/ERROR-LOG.md`,
  `templates/`. Seeded with `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001-repository-baseline.md`.
- **CHG-2026-09-06-008** — Added `.githooks/` — `secret-guard` engine plus
  `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks that refuse to commit or push any real
  `.env` / `.env.<anything>` / `.op.env` (only `*.example` / `*.sample` pass;
  `.envrc` allowed). `pre-push` scans the full tree at each pushed tip **and** the
  newly added commits. Activated with `core.hooksPath = .githooks` (run
  `sh .githooks/install` on a fresh clone). Bypass is `--no-verify` only.
  Paths: `.githooks/`. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-06-001`.

### Security

- **CHG-2026-09-06-007** — `.gitignore`: replaced the enumerated `.env` list with
  `.env` + `.env.*` + `.op.env` and `!*.example` / `!*.sample` negations. Closes a
  real gap — `.env.production`, `.env.staging`, and any other `.env.<name>` were
  **not** ignored before. Paths: `.gitignore`. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-06-003`.

### Fixed

- **CHG-2026-09-06-009** — Removed a misplaced `%SystemDrive%/ProgramData/…`
  Windows icon-cache tree from the repo root (written by a process with an
  unexpanded `%SystemDrive%` env var; not a git artefact) and added
  `.gitignore` guards: `/%SystemDrive%/`, `Thumbs.db`, `ehthumbs.db`,
  `[Dd]esktop.ini`, `$RECYCLE.BIN/`. Paths: `.gitignore`. Ref: `ERR-2026-09-06-004`.

### Housekeeping (outside the repo tree — no tracked-file change)

- **CHG-2026-09-06-002** — Moved the nested full clone `north-forge-agent/` (≈897 MB,
  its own `.git`) out of the checkout to
  `D:\north-forge-agent-attic\nested-clone-2026-09-06\`. It was a pristine second
  clone with zero unique commits; safe to delete once confirmed unneeded. Motivated
  by `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001` F-01.
- **CHG-2026-09-06-003** — Moved the unrelated stray file
  `marguerite-and-penny-suno.txt` out of the checkout to
  `D:\north-forge-agent-attic\`. Motivated by `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001` F-02.

### Known / carried forward

- `ERR-2026-09-06-001` (**OPEN**, HIGH) — live `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`.
  Exposure now structurally mitigated (CHG-007/008/009); still open pending the
  user's confirm-or-rotate decision on the key itself.
- `ERR-2026-09-06-002` (**OPEN**, MEDIUM) — fork is 2 behind upstream and carries no
  north-forge identity commit yet.
- `ERR-2026-09-06-003` (**RESOLVED**) — `.gitignore` `.env` coverage gap. Fixed by CHG-2026-09-06-007.
- `ERR-2026-09-06-004` (**RESOLVED**) — misplaced `%SystemDrive%` cache tree. Fixed by CHG-2026-09-06-009.
