# North-Forge Decision Register

Append-only. One row per **open judgment call** — a choice between defensible
options, not a fault. "Rebrand vs thin downstream", "keep or delete the attic
clone", "rename the `hermes` command" are decisions; a broken build or a leaked
secret is an error (`errors/ERROR-LOG.md`).

Never delete a row — close it by moving the block under `## Resolved` with a
`DECIDED` / `DEFERRED` / `DROPPED` status, a one-line rationale, and the
implementing `CHG-` id(s). A superseded or migrated item keeps its old id and
gains a `Superseded-by:` / `Supersedes:` link.

`DECISION-` id scheme, the `Confidence` vocabulary, and `Run:` ids are defined in
[`README.md`](../README.md).

### DECISION-2026-09-11-001 — Repo safety — how to stop GitHub fork-sync from silently discarding fork history a third time?

- **Opened:** 2026-09-11 · **Base:** hermes@8d79c2ff57 (228 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-11-002 (opened + decided + implemented same run — owner
  posed the exact options in the task prompt and picked between them via a direct
  question)
- **Source:** ERR-2026-09-11-001 (GitHub fork-sync force-reset `origin/main` to
  upstream, discarding 186 fork commits — 2nd occurrence, `main` had zero branch
  protection).
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — `gh api .../branches/main/protection` showed
  404 (no protection) before this decision, and the exact response fields
  (`allow_force_pushes`, `allow_fork_syncing`, `enforce_admins`) after.
- **Supersedes:** — none.
- **The call:** the fault is a **branch-level ref replacement** done outside git's
  merge logic (GitHub's "Sync fork" / `merge-upstream`, gated by its own
  `allow_fork_syncing` permission), not a per-file merge conflict. Two candidate
  safeguard shapes were on the table, aimed at different layers:
- **Options:**
  - **A — file-level: exclude `README.md`/`BRANDING.md`/`SOUL.md` from automatic
    merge conflict resolution** (custom merge driver / `.gitattributes`), forcing
    manual review whenever upstream touches them. Rejected as insufficient on its
    own: the actual incident was never a merge conflict — a branch reset replaces
    the whole tree in one ref update, so a merge-driver hook never runs and
    would not have fired.
  - **B — post-sync content check**, verifying North-Forge-identifying strings
    survive after any upstream sync, failing loudly if not. Real value as
    **detection**, but on its own is after-the-fact — it would catch the next
    reset within a day (scheduled) or at the next push/PR, not prevent it, and a
    reset that also wipes the workflow file that runs the check defeats it
    (though the CI run history itself would still show a gap, which is a
    detectable signal on review).
  - **C — GitHub branch protection on `main`** (`allow_force_pushes: false`,
    `allow_deletions: false`, `enforce_admins: true`, and specifically
    `allow_fork_syncing: false`) **(chosen, combined with B)**. This is the
    structural fix: it blocks the actual mechanism (any non-fast-forward ref
    update to `main`, including the fork-sync discard path) at the point it
    would occur, applies even to the repo owner (`enforce_admins`), and doesn't
    depend on a workflow file surviving the incident to be effective.
- **Decided:** 2026-09-11 (`RUN-2026-09-11-002`) — chose **C + B**: branch
  protection as the preventive gate (closes the actual hole — `allow_fork_syncing`
  is the GitHub-native permission for this exact feature), `nf-branding-guard.yml`
  as the detection layer underneath in case the gate is ever loosened or a
  different mechanism causes the same symptom. **A was not pursued** — the
  normal `git merge upstream/main` sync path was independently confirmed clean
  (a `git merge-tree` simulation against `upstream/main` on the last-good commit
  produced no conflict and preserved branding), so there is no per-file merge
  risk to guard against; adding a merge driver would be defense against a
  failure mode that doesn't reproduce. Implementing changes: **CHG-2026-09-11-003**
  (branch protection, applied via `gh api` — not a tracked-file change),
  **CHG-2026-09-11-004** (`.github/workflows/nf-branding-guard.yml`).
- **Blocking:** nothing — `main` remains fully usable for normal work (direct
  pushes from an authorized push are unaffected; only force-pushes, deletions,
  and fork-sync resets are blocked).
- **Owner:** Kenneth C. Walker Jr.
- **Status:** DECIDED

### DECISION-2026-09-10-001 — Access architecture — how does a Full-tier operator re-open Setup Run from inside a running session?

- **Opened:** 2026-09-10 · **Base:** hermes@0e9fc2cc15 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-10-001 (opened + decided + implemented same run — owner-directed; the WIP already carried the design and the owner asked to finish it)
- **Source:** in-flight work-in-progress found on the working tree (`hermes_cli/nf_admin.py` + `cli.py` wiring, referencing an unwritten `CHG-2026-09-09-004`); owner instruction this session to complete and land it.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — the options and their trade-offs were read directly from `scripts/nf-setup.ps1` (its `-Force` / passcode-prompt / RE-PROVISION path), `hermes_cli/nf_tier.py` (`verify_admin_passcode`, `write_provisioning`), and the WIP itself.
- **Supersedes:** — (builds on `DECISION-2026-09-07-003`, the edition/tier mechanism; does not change it — enforcement, signing, and the two tiers are untouched).
- **The call:** a Full-tier operator who needs to change tier / pin / edition on an already-provisioned drive currently has to quit the session and run `scripts/nf-setup.ps1` by hand. Should the running session offer a shortcut, and if so, how is it gated so it is invisible and inert to everyone else?
- **Options:**
  - **A — in-session passcode trigger (chosen).** The drive's admin passcode, typed as a bare message, defers to `nf-setup.ps1 -Force` after teardown, then re-execs `hermes`. Recogniser is Full-tier + passcode-set + exact-match only; every other input is indistinguishable from normal chat; recognised attempts are logged for the owner (never the passcode). Nothing is registered in any command table, completion, or help. Reuses `nf_tier.verify_admin_passcode` and `nf-setup.ps1` verbatim — no second verification or reconfiguration system.
  - **B — a `/edition`-style slash command behind a passcode prompt.** Discoverable (help, completion), which is the opposite of what a Full-tier-only admin action wants; still needs the same deferral + `nf-setup.ps1` call. Rejected: a visible surface for a privileged action, no upside over A.
  - **C — do nothing; document "quit and re-run `nf-setup.ps1`".** Zero new code, zero new surface. Rejected by the owner: the round-trip is the friction this is meant to remove, and A adds no reachable capability a Full operator does not already have (they hold the passcode and can already re-run Setup Run).
- **Decided:** 2026-09-10 (`RUN-2026-09-10-001`) — chose **A**. The trigger is a convenience over an ability the Full-tier operator already has (the admin passcode + the right to re-run Setup Run); it grants nothing new and changes no enforcement path. It is silent and unlogged-to-the-model on every non-matching input, and `-Force` in the launch path only lifts `write_provisioning`'s overwrite guard — `nf-setup.ps1` still prompts for and verifies the passcode. Implementing change: **`CHG-2026-09-10-001`** (`hermes_cli/nf_admin.py` new; `nf_tier.log_admin_attempt`/`admin_attempt_log_path`; `cli.py` + `cli_commands_mixin.py` wiring; `tests/test_nf_admin.py`).
- **Blocking:** nothing — the drive is fully usable without it; this removes an admin round-trip only.
- **Owner:** Kenneth C. Walker Jr.
- **Status:** DECIDED

### DECISION-2026-09-09-001 — Drive provisioning — bundle a Python toolchain on the drive, and how?

- **Opened:** 2026-09-09 · **Base:** hermes@0e9fc2cc15 (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-09-002 (opened + decided + implemented same run)
- **Source:** `D:\logs\CODEX-BUNDLED-PYTHON-FEASIBILITY.md` (feasibility pass this
  session); the Sandbox clean-machine gap noted after `NF-v0.8.2` — a recipient
  drive still assumed `python`/`uv` already existed on the host `PATH`.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — the feasibility pass read both the python.org
  embeddable's limitations and `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` / `nf-venv-state.ps1` /
  `nf-readiness.ps1` in the tree; the "no conflict with R1" claim is from that read
  and is now covered by tests.
- **Supersedes:** — (adjacent to `DECISION-2026-09-06-003`, the drive-native
  install model this completes; does not replace it).
- **The call:** which interpreter artifact to ship on a drive, and how it gets
  there, so `bootstrap` can build its venv with nothing on the recipient's PATH.
- **Options:**
  - **A — python.org Windows *embeddable* package + get-pip/virtualenv layering.**
    Official artifact, ~45–55 MB usable. But the embeddable is deliberately not a
    venv base: no `pip`/`ensurepip`, and its `._pth` isolation breaks venv `site`
    activation unless edited/deleted. More moving parts, more fragile across minor
    bumps.
  - **B — bundle `uv.exe` + a `python-build-standalone` CPython 3.11** (the
    distribution `uv` itself uses; relocatable, makes working venvs, carries pip).
    `uv venv --python <bundled path>` then needs no pip in the base and no `._pth`
    surgery. ~45–90 MB.
  - **How it arrives:** committed via git/LFS · fetched at recipient first-launch ·
    **admin prepares one master and copies it per drive during provisioning.**
- **Decided:** 2026-09-09 (`RUN-2026-09-09-002`) — chose **B**, staged as a
  **drive sibling `<parent>\<leaf>-toolchain\`** (mirroring `-venv` / `-data`),
  **never git-tracked**, **prepared once by the admin and copied onto each drive
  during provisioning** — not fetched at recipient first-launch, not stored via
  git/LFS. Rationale: matches the existing sibling-folder pattern; keeps the
  offline-capable promise intact (no first-launch network); keeps clones lean.
  Resolution order in `bootstrap`: **bundled toolchain → host PATH (admin/dev
  fallback only, logged as "using host toolchain (admin/dev)") → the existing
  clear error, unchanged.** Implementing change: **`CHG-2026-09-09-003`**
  (`scripts/lib/nf-toolchain.ps1` new read-only resolver; `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`
  resolution-order change only; `docs/BUILDING-A-DRIVE.md` +
  `docs/toolchain/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`; behavioural tests incl. a
  zero-PATH bundled build). No change to R1's ownership classifier or readiness
  probe — the toolchain folder is an input to venv creation, never a venv, and
  nothing in R1 classifies, deletes, or trusts it.
- **Blocking:** was blocking the Sandbox clean-machine retest; now unblocked.
- **Owner:** Kenneth C. Walker Jr.
- **Status:** DECIDED

### DECISION-2026-09-07-002 — Rebrand-claim wording — "engine used unmodified" / "full rebrand"

- **Opened:** 2026-09-07 · **Base:** hermes@233757037d (6 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-07-006 (opened) · RUN-2026-09-08-004 (decided + implemented)
- **Source:** Codex audit **F-07** (see `logs/CODEX-AUDIT-2026-09-07.md`).
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — the phrases and the counter-examples were
  verified in the tree.
- **Supersedes:** —
- **The call:** two `README.md` / `BRANDING.md` claims were broader than the code:
  1. *"engine used unmodified"* — fork commits do modify application files
     (`agent/prompt_builder.py`, `cli.py`, `hermes_cli/**`).
  2. *"full rebrand"* — true only under `BRANDING.md`'s narrow ownership taxonomy;
     not a full operator journey while some visible CLI strings (interactive
     welcome, chat subparser description) still said Hermes.
- **Options:**
  - **A — Tighten the wording.** Replace the phrases with a precise form; name the
    deliberately-Hermes visible surfaces in `BRANDING.md`. No identifier churn.
  - **B — Leave as-is.** Defensible under the stated taxonomy; headline claims
    mildly mislead an operator who reads only those.
- **Decided:** 2026-09-08 (`RUN-2026-09-08-004`) — chose **A**, owner-preference
  as leaned. Implemented by **`CHG-2026-09-08-010`** (wording) and
  **`CHG-2026-09-08-011`** (the two CLI surfaces):
  - "engine used unmodified" / "whatever Hermes Agent does, North Forge does"
    replaced with *"North Forge keeps Hermes Agent's functional engine behavior;
    its downstream changes are identity, presentation, and workflow only"* in
    `README.md` (×2), `README.es.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `README.ur-pk.md`, and
    `BRANDING.md` (×2).
  - `BRANDING.md` intro now names the visible CLI strings that stay Hermes on
    purpose (the `hermes` command + examples, `HERMES_HOME` paths, the engine
    help guidance, the `agent_name` skin fallback, OS-service descriptions,
    upstream setup/update/uninstall copy).
  - The two surfaces F-07 called out as still-Hermes were *fixed*, not just
    documented: `cli.py` interactive `_welcome_text` fallback → "Welcome to North
    Forge!" (matches `skins/north-forge.yaml`); `hermes_cli/_parser.py` `chat`
    subparser `description` → "Start an interactive chat session with North Forge
    (on the Hermes Agent engine)." Both added to `BRANDING.md` category 1.
  - "full rebrand" as a historical *decision label* stays in
    `DECISION-2026-09-06-001` (ids are immutable); no outward-facing doc makes the
    overstated headline claim any more.
- **Blocking:** nothing.
- **Owner:** Kenneth C. Walker Jr.
- **Status:** DECIDED

### DECISION-2026-09-06-003 — Install model — drive-native run-in-place vs machine-local managed install?

- **Opened:** 2026-09-07 · **Base:** hermes@693641aa8b (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-07-001 (opened) · RUN-2026-09-07-011 (ratified)
- **Id note:** the `2026-09-06` date in the id is kept at the owner's request, for
  continuity with the `-001` / `-002` rebrand batch; the entry was actually opened
  2026-09-07. (The daily-reset id rule in `README.md` is relaxed here by owner call.)
- **Source:** the consolidated pass of 2026-09-07 (step 4); the "portable-first"
  principle in [[north-forge-architecture]]; the minimal bootstrap shipped this
  pass (`CHG-2026-09-07-005`).
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — the two shapes and their trade-offs are as
  stated; the shipped implementation named under **Decided** was read in the tree
  and exercised across `RUN-2026-09-07-005` … `-010`, and independently reviewed by
  two Codex audits (`logs/CODEX-AUDIT-2026-09-07.md`;
  `logs/CODEX-HERMES-EDITION-REUSE-CHECK-2026-09-07.md`).
- **Supersedes:** —
- **The call:** when North Forge is deployed on a drive, does it **run in place
  from the drive** (portable, self-contained, nothing installed on the host) or
  does it perform a **managed install into a machine-local location**
  (`~/.hermes`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`) the way upstream's installer does?
- **Options:**
  - **A — Drive-native run-in-place:** the venv and `HERMES_HOME` data folder live
    as siblings of the checkout on the same drive; nothing is written to the host;
    unplug and move to another machine. Matches portable-first. Cost: slower cold
    start, venv rebuild if the drive path changes, no host PATH integration.
  - **B — Machine-local managed install:** bootstrap installs into `~/.hermes` /
    `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` like upstream — faster, host PATH integration,
    survives drive re-lettering. Cost: leaves state on every host it touches; not
    portable; contradicts portable-first.
  - **C — Hybrid:** drive-native by default, an opt-in flag for a machine install.
    Most flexible; more surface to build and document.
- **Leaning at open:** **A (drive-native)**, provisionally — consistent with the
  portable-first principle already established. **Explicitly not ratified.** The
  *hardened* form of A — sealing the drive, the dual-volume
  `NORTHFORGE` / `NORTHFORGE-DATA` split, and the certify / verify / audit
  machinery — is **out of scope** for the current pass and waits for real
  ratification of this decision. What ships now (`CHG-2026-09-07-005`,
  `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1` + `north-forge.cmd`) is only the *minimal*
  single-drive, single-folder-tree bootstrap + launcher: enough to make a fresh
  clone launch, deliberately **not** built on the unratified hardened design.
- **Decided:** 2026-09-07 (`RUN-2026-09-07-011`) — **ratified A (drive-native
  run-in-place)**, owner call. The sibling-venv layout (venv + `HERMES_HOME` data
  folder as siblings of the checkout on the same drive, nothing written to the
  host), the launch-readiness probe (`scripts/nf-preflight.ps1` +
  `scripts/lib/nf-readiness.ps1` — detects a moved or re-lettered drive and
  rebuilds the venv **in place**, never on the host), and the tier / pin system
  (`hermes_cli/nf_tier.py` + on-drive `provisioning.json` / `.nf-key`, `NF-v0.6.0`)
  together are already a **working, tested implementation of exactly this model** —
  no machine-local state, portable between machines by design. Two separate Codex
  audits reviewed this surface independently and both found the implementation
  matches the drive-native shape: the `F-01`…`F-10` baseline audit
  (`logs/CODEX-AUDIT-2026-09-07.md`) and the hermes-edition reuse check
  (`logs/CODEX-HERMES-EDITION-REUSE-CHECK-2026-09-07.md` — *"north-forge-agent
  already has working equivalents: `bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`, `north-forge.cmd`,
  `nf-preflight.ps1`, `make-drive-root-shortcut.ps1`"*).
  - **Implementing commits — `NF-v0.5.1` → `NF-v0.6.0`:** `CHG-2026-09-07-015`
    (bootstrap path-safety guard — venv/data may not equal, sit inside, or contain
    the checkout), `CHG-2026-09-07-020` (four-check launch-time readiness probe +
    silent in-place venv-only rebuild), `CHG-2026-09-07-022` (tier / pinned-edition
    control, all state on the drive) are the load-bearing ones; built on the
    original minimal bootstrap `CHG-2026-09-07-005` (`NF-v0.3.0`).
  - **B and C rejected:** B (machine-local managed install) leaves state on every
    host and contradicts portable-first; C (hybrid opt-in machine install) adds
    surface with no established need.
- **Hardened form — now unblocked, not mandated:** the sealed-drive / dual-volume
  `NORTHFORGE` + `NORTHFORGE-DATA` split / certify-verify-audit work this entry
  parked is no longer gated on an unratified decision. Ratifying A does **not**
  order that work built — starting it is a separate scheduling call. This remains
  the ratified home `DECISION-2026-09-07-003` named for a future non-drive-resident
  key store.
- **Blocking:** the hardened install / seal / dual-volume / certification work was
  blocked until this was `DECIDED` — **cleared 2026-09-07** (`RUN-2026-09-07-011`);
  see "Hardened form" above. The minimal bootstrap was never blocked and shipped in
  `NF-v0.3.0`.

### DECISION-2026-09-06-002 — Attic clone — keep or delete it?

- **Opened:** 2026-09-06 · **Base:** hermes@693641aa8b (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-06-001 (opened) · RUN-2026-09-07-011 (decided)
- **Source:** `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001` F-01 (`CHG-2026-09-06-002`) and its open-item #5;
  restated in `AUDIT-2026-09-06-002` open-item #5.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — `D:\north-forge-agent-attic\nested-clone-2026-09-06\`
  is a pristine second clone (~869 MB, `.git` ≈ 713 MB), zero unique commits,
  same `origin`/`upstream` remotes; it was moved there out of the checkout, never deleted.
  Re-confirmed present and unchanged 2026-09-07 (`RUN-2026-09-07-011`).
- **Supersedes:** — (this was never an `ERR-` row; it lived only as an audit
  finding + recommendation).
- **The call:** now that `origin/main` carries the real work (`e6c97b43ef`, pushed
  and verified), is the local safety copy still worth ~869 MB?
- **Options:**
  - **A — Delete** `D:\north-forge-agent-attic\nested-clone-2026-09-06\` — reclaim
    ~869 MB. `origin/main` + a fresh `git clone` fully reconstruct it.
  - **B — Keep** it as a cold offline backup (useful only if GitHub is
    unreachable *and* the working `.git` is also lost — a narrow scenario).
- **Leaning at open:** **A (delete)** — the pushed, verified `origin/main` removes the
  reason it was kept. Low urgency (disk is 76% free).
- **Decided:** 2026-09-07 (`RUN-2026-09-07-011`) — chose **A (delete)**, owner call,
  same batch and same reasoning as the ratification of `DECISION-2026-09-06-003`:
  `origin/main` carries everything, the attic copy holds zero unique commits, and a
  fresh `git clone` plus the pushed history fully reconstruct it. B's narrow
  "GitHub unreachable *and* the local `.git` also lost" scenario does not justify
  ~869 MB.
  - **Implementing step — done 2026-09-07** (`RUN-2026-09-07-011`): ran
    `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "D:\north-forge-agent-attic\nested-clone-2026-09-06"`
    after verifying the copy had zero unique commits (`820106d4a5` is an ancestor of
    `origin/main`), no local branches, no stashes, no uncommitted work. **~895 MB
    reclaimed** on `D:`. The sibling file
    `D:\north-forge-agent-attic\marguerite-and-penny-suno.txt` was **not** touched;
    the now near-empty `D:\north-forge-agent-attic\` directory was left in place.
- **Blocking:** nothing — disk space only.

### DECISION-2026-09-07-003 — Edition / tier mechanism — what is an "edition", and how is Basic tier enforced?

- **Opened:** 2026-09-07 · **Base:** hermes@2237be3559 (0 behind upstream/main) — written on `13fd25e063`, rebased clean onto `origin/main` `a4ffbca513`
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-07-010 (opened and decided the same run)
- **Source:** the owner's tier/pin build assignment (RUN-2026-09-07-010 prompt);
  the two-tier access model in [[north-forge-architecture]]; a queued research
  question (`logs/CODEX-VISION-SKETCH-2026-09-07.md` — **never produced**, so this
  run did its own check first).
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — the existing mechanisms and their enforcement
  points were read in the tree and exercised this run (`config.yaml`
  `skills.disabled` is enforced at `tools/skills_tool.py:553`, not only in
  listings; profile selection funnels through
  `hermes_cli/main.py::_apply_profile_override` → `resolve_profile_env`;
  `cryptography` / `pynacl` are project deps but **not** in the bare dev venv).
- **Supersedes:** —
- **The call:** North Forge needs "editions" (generic chassis, Kyocera, Penny
  Pincher, Sales, Pine Barron Farms) with exactly one **pinned** front-door per
  drive and a two-tier lock (Full = switcher; Basic = pin only, unreachable
  otherwise, enforced at command dispatch not just the UI). Nothing in the tree
  had a "tier" or a lockable profile. What is an edition, mechanically, and where
  is the lock?
- **Options:**
  - **A — Edition = a Hermes profile; tier/pin = a signed North-Forge record +
    gates at every profile-selection path.** Reuses profile isolation (SOUL.md,
    `skills/`, `mcp.json`, `config.yaml`, state) and `distribution.yaml`
    packaging. New `hermes_cli/nf_tier.py` + `provisioning.json` (HMAC-signed) +
    small calls in `_apply_profile_override`, `resolve_profile_env`,
    `set_active_profile`, `profile_cmd`, the dashboard router, and a `/edition`
    command. Cost: the lock surface is every profile entry point (six of them) —
    each must be covered.
  - **B — Edition = a persona overlay + a `config.yaml` `skills.disabled`
    filter.** Lightest; enforcement rides entirely on the existing
    `skills_tool.py:553` invocation gate. Cost: an edition cannot carry its own
    MCP servers, model config, or state — too thin for Kyocera (hotline tooling,
    KB builder, drift audits), and "sees everything including Pine Barron Farms"
    implies editions are separate installs.
  - **C — Hybrid:** edition = profile, but selection routed through one new
    North-Forge chokepoint that disables every other path. Cost: same wide
    lockdown surface as A with more indirection.
- **Leaning at open:** A.
- **Decided:** 2026-09-07 (`RUN-2026-09-07-010`) — chose **A**, owner-confirmed
  (edition = full Hermes profile; HMAC-signed provisioning keyed by the admin
  passcode, fail-closed; wire every selection path in one pass). Implemented by
  **`CHG-2026-09-07-022`** (`NF-v0.6.0`).
  - **Signature strength, stated honestly:** the record is HMAC-SHA256 with the
    key stored on the drive (`<nf-root>/north-forge/.nf-key`, `0600`, outside
    `profiles/`). That is **tamper-evident, not tamper-proof** — it fails a
    casual `"basic"`→`"full"` edit closed; it is not a defence against an operator
    who will find `.nf-key` and script a re-sign. Asymmetric signing (Ed25519 via
    `cryptography`/`pynacl`) was rejected for this pass: the verifier runs in
    `main.py` **before argparse and before any hermes import**, where pulling in
    `cryptography` is a cost and a "must never block startup" risk, and the bare
    dev venv does not even carry it. The real containment for proprietary edition
    content is that it is **not shipped to a Basic drive at all**; the admin
    passcode (`.nf-admin`, pbkdf2) additionally gates *re-running* `nf-setup.ps1`.
    A future hardened-drive form (sealed volume, dual-partition split) could carry
    a real key store — that is **out of scope here and tracked under
    `DECISION-2026-09-06-003`**, which this does **not** resolve.
  - **Fail-open vs fail-closed boundary:** *absent* record = un-provisioned =
    behaves exactly like upstream Hermes (dev checkouts / CI / plain installs
    unaffected — keeps fork drift testable). *Present but unverifiable* = tampered
    = the drive refuses to start. These are deliberately different.
- **Intersection noted (not resolved):** `DECISION-2026-09-06-003` (install
  model — drive-native vs machine-local; hardened form awaits ratification). The
  hardened drive is where a non-drive-resident key store would live; this pass
  builds only the minimal signed-file form and does not pre-empt that decision.

### DECISION-2026-09-07-001 — Splash art — keep the stock Hermes launch mark, or swap it?

- **Opened:** 2026-09-07 · **Base:** hermes@233757037d (6 behind upstream/main) — committed on `c4e88d2ab6`
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-07-004 (opened and decided the same run)
- **Id note:** first `DECISION-` dated 2026-09-07, so `-001` per the daily-reset
  rule in [`README.md`](../README.md) § Naming. Unrelated to the `2026-09-06`-dated
  `-002` / `-003` (whose dates were pinned by owner call for continuity with the
  rebrand batch).
- **Source:** carried since `RUN-2026-09-07-003` — the `INDEX.md` "Latest run" row
  recorded the `⚕ NOUS HERMES` launch splash as **"left open for the owner (not
  defaulted)"**. Raised again by the owner this run alongside the drive-native
  onboarding fixes, now that final brand art exists under `assets/icons/`.
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — verified in the checkout that
  `hermes_cli/banner.py` `HERMES_CADUCEUS` (the `⚕` braille hero) and
  `HERMES_AGENT_LOGO` (the `HERMES-AGENT` wordmark) are **byte-identical to
  `upstream/main`**; NF's only diff to that file is the one-line
  `format_banner_version_label()` label. `banner.py` already prefers
  `skin.banner_hero` / `skin.banner_logo` over those constants
  (`banner.py:855`, `:916`).
- **Supersedes:** —
- **The call:** the CLI shows upstream's `⚕` caduceus + `HERMES-AGENT` wordmark at
  every `hermes` / `north-forge.cmd` launch. Leave it, or replace it with North
  Forge's own mark?
- **Options:**
  - **A — Leave as-is.** Consistent with "engine used unmodified"; the ASCII
    startup art is not in `BRANDING.md`'s North-Forge-owned list;
    `assets/icons/splash-alt.png` is already earmarked for a future *graphical*
    loading screen. Zero change.
  - **B — Edit `banner.py`.** Replace the `HERMES_AGENT_LOGO` constant (and maybe
    the caduceus) with North Forge art. Small text swap, but a permanent
    multi-line diff on a hot upstream file — merge-conflict risk on every rebase.
  - **C — Swap via a North Forge skin.** Ship `skins/north-forge.yaml` with
    `banner_logo` / `banner_hero`; `banner.py` stays byte-identical to upstream
    except its existing one-liner. Slightly more than a "text swap" (new skin
    file + activation wiring) but zero added engine drift. The repo's brand PNGs
    can't render in a terminal, so the art is new Rich-markup ASCII either way.
- **Leaning at open:** C.
- **Decided:** 2026-09-07 (`RUN-2026-09-07-004`) — chose **C (swap via a North
  Forge skin)**, owner-selected. Implemented by **`CHG-2026-09-07-012`**: new
  tracked `skins/north-forge.yaml` (`banner_logo` "NORTH FORGE" ANSI-Shadow +
  `banner_hero` anvil/sparks + full North-Forge `branding`; colors/spinner
  inherited from the built-in `default` skin). `scripts/bootstrap-north-forge.ps1`
  seeds it into `HERMES_HOME/skins/` and sets `display.skin=north-forge` on a
  fresh bootstrap (never overriding an operator's own skin choice);
  `north-forge.cmd` re-copies it every launch. `hermes_cli/banner.py` and
  `hermes_cli/skin_engine.py` are **unchanged**. Verified end-to-end against the
  drive venv — the activated skin drives the banner and the `⚕`/`HERMES`
  constants are no longer reached on that path.
- **Reaffirmed:** 2026-09-07 (`RUN-2026-09-07-006`). A mid-stream instruction in
  the `RUN-2026-09-07-005` batch floated deferring this and reverting the skin
  swap; that reversal was **never executed** (RUN-005 shipped only the F-04 fix),
  and the owner's follow-up confirmed **keep the shipped swap — stays DECIDED
  (C), not DEFERRED**. No code change; the `RUN-2026-09-07-005` INDEX hedge notes
  about a "pending deferral" were corrected.
- **Owner:** Kenneth C. Walker Jr.
- **Status:** DECIDED

### DECISION-2026-09-06-001 — Fork identity — rebrand vs thin downstream?

- **Opened:** 2026-09-06 · **Base:** hermes@693641aa8b (0 behind upstream/main)
- **Run:** RUN-2026-09-06-001 (opened) · RUN-2026-09-06-002 (implemented)
- **Source:** `AUDIT-2026-09-06-001` §6 (full README review) and F-06 / F-08
- **Confidence:** Confirmed Fact — the branding state is verified (every `README*.md`,
  `SOUL.md`, `LICENSE`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml` field is still upstream's);
  the *choice* between the two shapes is what is open.
- **Supersedes:** the identity half of `ERR-2026-09-06-002` (migrated here — the
  version-drift half of that ERR was a real fault and stays in `ERROR-LOG.md`,
  RESOLVED by `CHG-2026-09-06-014`).
- **The call:** does north-forge present as its own product, or stay a
  lightly-marked fork kept rebased on `NousResearch/hermes-agent`?
- **Options:**
  - **A — Thin downstream:** add a short north-forge note atop `README.md` + a
    root `CLAUDE.md` (provenance + what north-forge adds + the ledger workflow);
    leave `SOUL.md` / `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` as upstream's. Cheapest
    upstream merges forever; north-forge stays visibly a downstream user.
  - **B — Full rebrand:** rewrite the top of `README.md`, `SOUL.md` persona, the
    `name` / `repository` / `homepage` fields in `package.json` and
    `pyproject.toml`, add the maintainer's copyright line alongside Nous's in
    `LICENSE` (MIT — Nous's line stays). More friction on every future
    `upstream/main` merge; north-forge reads as its own project.
- **Leaning:** **B (full rebrand)** — selected by the maintainer on 2026-09-06.
- **Blocking:** `NF-v0.2.0` (the changelog reserves `NF-v0.2.0` for the first
  identity commit). Nothing else.
- **Owner:** Kenneth C. Walker Jr.
- **Decided:** 2026-09-06 — chose **B (full rebrand)**. Implemented in one
  branding-only commit under `RUN-2026-09-06-002`: `README.md` top-level identity
  rewritten, `SOUL.md` re-voiced to North Forge's established persona,
  `package.json` `name` / `repository` / `homepage` / `bugs` repointed to
  `kwalker7631/north-forge-agent` (+ `package-lock.json` root-name sync),
  `pyproject.toml` gained `[project.urls]`, `LICENSE` gained the maintainer's
  copyright line alongside Nous Research's. Per the carve-out in this entry, the
  `pyproject.toml` **distribution name `hermes-agent` was left unchanged** (never
  published, ~19× internal refs, pinned in `uv.lock`). No application code, no
  `.env`, no attic-clone change — agent behaviour identical before and after.
  Cut `NF-v0.2.0` (MAJOR). Committed locally, **not pushed** (held for review).
  Implementing changes: `CHG-2026-09-06-020`, `CHG-2026-09-06-021`,
  `CHG-2026-09-06-022`, `CHG-2026-09-06-023`, `CHG-2026-09-06-024`.
- **Follow-up:** 2026-09-06 (`RUN-2026-09-06-003`, `NF-v0.2.1`, PATCH) — the two
  loose ends the rebrand commit left: `assets/banner.png` re-branded to North
  Forge and re-referenced in `README.md` (**placeholder art**, flagged in the
  PNG `tEXt` chunks — final art still owed), and two drive-facing README sections
  added ("Drive class", "Customizing your agent"). No code / `.env` / dist-name
  change. `CHG-2026-09-06-025`, `CHG-2026-09-06-026`. Local only, not pushed.
- **Status:** DECIDED

| DECISION-2026-09-06-002 | 2026-09-06 | Repo hygiene | Keep or delete the attic clone? | DECIDED — A (delete), `RUN-2026-09-07-011` / `CHG-2026-09-07-023`. `origin/main` carries all work, zero unique commits in the copy; `D:\north-forge-agent-attic\nested-clone-2026-09-06\` **deleted 2026-09-07** (~895 MB reclaimed) | 2026-09-07 |
| DECISION-2026-09-06-003 | 2026-09-07 | Install model | Drive-native run-in-place vs machine-local managed install? | DECIDED — A (drive-native run-in-place), `RUN-2026-09-07-011` / `CHG-2026-09-07-023`. Sibling-venv + `nf-preflight.ps1` + `nf_tier.py` (`NF-v0.5.1`→`NF-v0.6.0`) already implement it; two Codex audits concur. Hardened form (seal / dual-volume / certify) now unblocked, not mandated | 2026-09-07 |
| DECISION-2026-09-07-001 | 2026-09-07 | Branding | Keep the stock Hermes launch splash, or swap it? | DECIDED — C (swap via a North Forge skin), landed `CHG-2026-09-07-012`; reaffirmed `RUN-2026-09-07-006` (deferral floated then withdrawn, never executed) | 2026-09-07 |
| DECISION-2026-09-07-003 | 2026-09-07 | Access architecture | What is an "edition", and how is Basic tier enforced? | DECIDED — A (edition = Hermes profile; HMAC-signed `provisioning.json` + gates at every profile-selection path), landed `CHG-2026-09-07-022` (`NF-v0.6.0`). Signature is tamper-evident not tamper-proof; hardened key store deferred to `DECISION-2026-09-06-003` | 2026-09-07 |
| DECISION-2026-09-07-002 | 2026-09-07 | Branding wording | "engine used unmodified" / "full rebrand" broader than the code (Codex F-07) | **DECIDED** — A (tighten wording), `RUN-2026-09-08-004` / `CHG-2026-09-08-010`+`-011`. README ×2 + 3 translations + BRANDING ×2 reworded; `cli.py` welcome + `_parser.py` chat description moved to North Forge; BRANDING names the deliberately-Hermes surfaces | 2026-09-08 |
| DECISION-2026-09-09-001 | 2026-09-09 | Drive provisioning | Bundle a Python toolchain on the drive, and how? | **DECIDED** — B (bundle `uv.exe` + a `python-build-standalone` CPython 3.11 as a never-git-tracked drive sibling `<parent>\<leaf>-toolchain\`, admin-prepared once and copied per drive — not fetched at first-launch, not git/LFS). `RUN-2026-09-09-002` / `CHG-2026-09-09-003` (`NF-v0.9.0`). Resolution order: bundled → host PATH (admin/dev, logged) → existing error. No change to R1 | 2026-09-09 |
| DECISION-2026-09-10-001 | 2026-09-10 | Access architecture | How does a Full-tier operator re-open Setup Run from inside a running session? | **DECIDED** — A (in-session admin-passcode trigger → `nf-setup.ps1 -Force` after teardown, then re-exec; Full-tier + passcode-set + exact-match only, silent and inert on every other input, recognised attempts logged for the owner without the passcode). `RUN-2026-09-10-001` / `CHG-2026-09-10-001` (`NF-v0.10.0`). Owner-directed. Grants no reachable capability a Full operator lacks; no enforcement path changed. Builds on `DECISION-2026-09-07-003` | 2026-09-10 |
| DECISION-2026-09-11-001 | 2026-09-11 | Repo safety | How to stop GitHub fork-sync from silently discarding fork history a third time? | **DECIDED** — C+B (GitHub branch protection on `main`: `allow_force_pushes:false`, `allow_fork_syncing:false`, `enforce_admins:true` — the structural fix — plus `nf-branding-guard.yml` CI content check as detection). A (exclude branding files from merge conflict resolution) not pursued — the fault was a branch-level reset, not a merge conflict; the normal `git merge upstream/main` path was independently confirmed clean. `RUN-2026-09-11-002` / `CHG-2026-09-11-003`+`-004`. Resolves ERR-2026-09-11-001 | 2026-09-11 |
